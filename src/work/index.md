# Work

My current work sees me specializing in user interface (UI) design. I work on an array of digital products for medical students, faculty, and other people in academic medicine.

Previously, I was a web designer at a flagship state university. During my time there, we entered the [responsive web design](https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/) era and moved from a legacy CMS (and tons of static sites) to a managed WordPress environment.

Before that, I trained as a graphic designer. I used to do a lot more traditional print work (packaging, posters, publications, etc.) and I have the x-acto scars to prove it.

I have a [CV](/work/cv.html) and a [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nsmsn/) profile.
