    <h1>${ title }</h1>

    <p>A collection of music Iâ€™ve accumulated over the years. I only buy records I intend to listen to, so everything here has been played again and again.</p>
    
    <p>Releases are organized alphabetically by artist, and chronologically by release date. It will be some time before the collection is fully cataloged, so this page is very much a work in progress.</p>
