Before the gig app economy, there was the [gig mill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gig-mill) economy.

I first encountered the term "Luddite" in the late 1990s or ealy 2000s. It was the name of a band formed at the local high school, in which my neighbor, an older boy, played bass. [Rage Against The Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rage_Against_the_Machine) was probably a direct influence. But the actual Luddites, those machine smashers of the early 19th Century might as well have existed during the witch trials of the 17th Century, at least in my early adolescent imagination.

The true story of the Luddites, as told in Brian Merchant's illuminating book _[Blood in the Machine](https://bookshop.org/a/21729/9780316487740)_ is that they weren't against every machine or labor-saving device. They didn't smash their own hand looms, which they themselves had mastered and perfected over time. Automation wasn't an abstraction coming for their jobs or their way of life. It was the tool of entrepreneurs to make their livelihood obsolete in favor of cheaper labor and cheaper textile goods.

The invention of the cotton gin exacerbated slavery in North America, even as its inventor imagined it might bring an end to that cruel system. It was automation and the factory system that created child labor, and the Luddites were trying to warn everyone else that they were going to be the next to be exploited. Before they became Luddites and turned to property destruction, the weavers tried to negotiate with Parliament and the industrialists to phase in the technology over time, offering progressive reformist ideas like profit sharing, or a tax on the machines which would provide for the workers displaced. In turn, the state made organizing illegal. Eventually, machine destruction was punishable by death.

The quote in the book that sticks out to me was: "If the Luddites never existed, the tech industry would have invented them." Writing off a technology skeptic as a reactionary fool or a zealot against progress is convenient and dismissive. In fact, in the Luddites' own time, they were celebrated as real Robin Hood figures, and even influenced literary contemporaries like Lord Byron and Mary Shelley.

More than 200 years after the Luddite uprisings, there are plenty of lessons for us today, as Merchant makes explicit in his book. It's not the robots coming for our jobs, but our bosses. If you work in tech, you need to read this book.
