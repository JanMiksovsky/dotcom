<p>I immediately feel like a bad person for being here<br/>
And bringing you into this place<br/>
So convenient and impersonal</p>

<p>You quickly realize this is not a real restaurant<br/> 
And proceed to take off your shoes and socks<br/>
And run across the long green vinyl booth</p>

<p>But the souvlaki and tzatziki hits the spot and<br/> 
You seem to enjoy your grilled cheese sandwich<br/>
We split the carrots and celery sticks</p>

<p>A little later “Marquee Moon” starts playing&mdash;<br/>
Tom Verlaine would never approve of this place&mdash;<br/>
I glimpse one or two workers in the kitchen and try to make eye contact<br/>
Bending my glance around the thick white tile</p>

## About this poem

This poem is about sharing a meal with my three year old daughter in downtown NYC while my wife was in the city for work. Hudson Square is one location among dozens for Wonder, a retail dining and meal delivery concept with a handful of people in the kitchen and no one behind the counter. Wonder is apparently what happens when you wander around the city with a small child and no clear dinner plans.
