Our family was planning to attend a flu and covid shot clinic at an elementary school last week. The covid vaccine shipment was delayed for this event, and the three of us were all feeling sick, so we ended up not going.

Our daughter was diagnosed with an ear infection, and she got her flu shot at the pediatrician last week. Our pediatrician's office is not carrying the Covid-19 vaccines this year. So far, using [vaccines.gov](https://vaccines.gov), I managed to find one pharmacy in my area that is actually scheduling appointments for kids underÂ 3. Anecdotally, I'm hearing similar things from parents in other parts of the country (we live in the Southwest United States).

We got an appointment today, because who knows when they'll run out, and when they'll get it in again? I live in a city of nearly 600,000 people and this pharmacy (Smith's grocery, owned by the Kroger conglomerate) does not take certain major insurances (like Cigna, for example).

I keep reading that [Covid is ramping up everywhere right now](https://www.thedailybeast.com/covid-is-ramping-up-for-a-year-of-deadly-surges), and the [vaccine rollout is scattered](https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/18/health/covid-vaccine-awareness-campaigns/index.html) in the U.S. this fall. We're trying to do everything we can to protect ourselves and the people around us during virus season, including getting the little one vaccinated.

Nearly four years since the pandemic started, it feels like the responsibility for this has fully shifted to the individual. That sucks.
