I wasn't planning to write a year in review post, but having blogged all year long, it is actually quite easy to put one together.

## Winter

- Started learning [Figma](https://www.figma.com) and [Webflow](https://webflow.com). Still learning both these new-to-me tools, but think they'll be part of my workflow more in 2024.
- Soft launch of [Typo.town](https://typo.town), my side project on typography.
- Joined the Literal Librarians and started cleaning up book metadata for free.
- Celebrated our daughter's first birthday!

## Spring

- Turned 36.
- Purchased a home in Albuquerque.
- Packed, listed, and sold our home in Knoxville.
- [Started using Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/user/nsmsn) to keep track of my music habits, like it's 2006.
- Went to HQ at work for the fist time.

## Summer

- Moved into our new home in ABQ.
- Joined a book club at work.
- Traded in our old car, got a [new license plate](https://nicksimson.com/notes/rss-license-plate/).
- Celebrated 13 years of marriage!
- Attended a nephew's 6th birthday party.
- Delivered my first [Toastmasters](https://www.toastmasters.org) speech.

## Fall

- [Redesigned this website](https://nicksimson.com/posts/hello-wordpress/)!
- Attended my other nephew's 2nd birthday party.
- [Annular solar eclipse](https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2023/where-when/). That was pretty cool...could not take a good photo of it, though.
- Celebrated one year at my current job.
- [Carved a pumpkin](https://nicksimson.com/notes/halloween-2023/).
- Saw the [O'Keefe and Moore](https://nicksimson.com/notes/okeefe-moore/) exhibit.
- Kicked off a micro trend of [WordPress plugin inventory](/posts/2023-wp-plugin-inventory.html) posts.
- Joined [Wiggle Work](https://wiggle.work/), an online community for remote tech workers.
- [Washington, DC trip](/posts/2023-two-nights-in-dc.html).

Well, that was a year. Let's do it again, I guess.
