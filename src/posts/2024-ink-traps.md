![Day 9: Ink Traps](images/26Days-I-Inktrap-1024x576.png)

Back before I started making and keeping [lists of fonts](https://typo.town/font-lists), I did what I imagine a "normal" person might do. I started out typing out my text (maybe a headline or a paragraph) into a word processor or design app, and would literally go through the font menu one by one, until something interesting popped up. That was how I came across this:

A complete approximation of my design. I truly can't remember the content at all.

I kind of liked it! That heading feels _wrong_, in a weirdly satisfying way. Was this a lost [Emigre](https://www.emigre.com/) font from the 1990s? I looked up closer at the font menu: **Bell Centennial BT**. The weight was **Bold Listing**. Here was the phone book font, teaching me all about ink traps.

> Maybe the most unique of Bell Centennial's forms are in place to solve problems during production. Since the phonebook is printed at high speeds and on low-quality paper, the ink has a tendency to spread out on the paper (this effect is called “dot gain”). Since the slightest spread greatly effects the shape of such small letterforms, \[Matthew\] Carter incorporated [notches](https://nicksherman.com/articles/bellCentennial/inkTraps.gif) (called “ink traps”) at the corners for compensation.

Ink traps are features from metal typesetting, especially at small sizes, that prevent ink from pooling or bleeding at the intersection of certain strokes. (The first time I used a [letterpress machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandercook) was a few years after college) Printing technology has changed, but this carryover from the hot metal days is still being employed by digital type designers.

A digital type designer might employ ink traps into their design if they are designing for small [optical sizes](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/optical_sizes). Check out [Retina by Tobias Frere-Jones](https://frerejones.com/families/retina) for an excellent example. If a newer typeface is referencing historical designs, ink traps might come into play, as with [Bricolage Grotesque](https://ateliertriay.github.io/bricolage/), one of my new favorite libre web fonts. Or the ink traps might take on a life of their own, as in [Dinamo's Whyte Inktrap](https://abcdinamo.com/news/typeface-release-abc-whyte-inktrap), and [Type Forward's Oddvall](https://www.typeforward.com/blog/ink-traps-and-ovals-the-story-of-oddval). Who says a sans-serif can't be decorative?

I wrote about the [Halyard family](https://nicksimson.com/posts/halyard/) in yesterday's edition of [26 Days of Type](https://nicksimson.com/26-days-of-type/), and I want to spend a little more time examining the Micro version. In the samples below, I showcase the Micro weights and italic styles at large sizes (240 pt in my Illustrator file) to demonstrate how changes in weights alter the appearance of the ink traps and the characters themselves. I especially wanted to highlight the **8** in this example:

That lowercase **x** though...

## Don't fall into a trap

I think it's a bit trendy right now to use ink trap fonts at exaggerated sizes. So like all trends, this might look dated in a few years. I also have my own unanswered questions about the legibility/readability of certain characters at various sizes. Remember that these little details may be forgiving in one area, and a nightmare in other places. I would avoid ink traps in anything embroidered or screen-printed, unless you are a fan of "happy accidents"[1](#4260bfa1-ee6f-4c83-860d-6584c813b7c3). But if you truly are printing small type on cheap paper, ink traps have not worn out their utility.
