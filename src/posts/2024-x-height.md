A typeface’s x-height refers to the height of its lowercase x. That’s pretty much it.

This measurement, like so many things in typography is about relationships. The relationship between the lowercase and uppercase letters; the height of the ascenders and descenders; and sometimes the appearance of the numerals in a typeface.

A typeface's x-height can influence it's legibility: typefaces with shorter x-heights will have longer ascenders and descenders. [Dunbar](https://v-fonts.com/fonts/dunbar) is one example of a variable font with an x-height axis, meaning the height of the lowercase letters is customizable.

X-height is one of the first things I look for when choosing type for a project. I personally find type with a taller x-height more legible and more appealing to work with on the web. In general, I find more typefaces designed in the 1970s and later (including the "[web-safe fonts](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/system_font_web_safe_font)") have taller x-heights.
