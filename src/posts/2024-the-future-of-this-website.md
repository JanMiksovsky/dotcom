I'm starting to sketch out the next major version of nicksimson.com, and there are a few things that might be changing around here. These are loosely held thoughts, not final decisions. I thought I'd just share these \[possible breaking changes\] if it helps anyone out there.

## Moving away from WordPress

The [past week's drama with Matt Mullenweg](https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/27/24256361/wordpress-wp-engine-drama-explained-matt-mullenweg) has left me with a bad taste in my mouth. This site is currently hosted by a company owned by WPEngine<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>, by the way. Before the drama exploded this past week, I've spent some free time in the last few weeks exploring [Kirby](https://getkirby.com/), and have long been thinking about migrating my blog/notes content to another platform. [It's only been a year](/posts/2023-hello-wordpress.html), after all.

In my decade-plus web development career, I've met dozens of kind, humble, and helpful people working in the WordPress ecosystem. A tech project run by a "benevolent" dictator just doesn't feel like the right fit for my web presence long term.

I'm abandoning any earlier plans to try building my own full-site editing/block theme. The idea of that just doesn't spark joy<sup><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> right now. When I left my higher ed job (running a network of WP sites) and went to work in a Drupal shop, I took a full year and a half break from any WordPress development. I'd be fine taking another break, honestly.

## Unplugging ActivityPub

I loathe the term "fediverse," and the more palatable ["social web" is being used in weird gatekeep-y ways](https://bix.blog/posts/2024-09-24-holy-hell-the-social-web-did-not-begin-in-2008) lately. The more I follow these conversations, the less I want to hitch my wagon to this stuff. Setting up ActivityPub on this site (even with the plugin) [was a trip](/posts/2024-i-broke-activitypub.html), and I don't feel like doing it again. I'll hang on to my social profiles as long as they are useful to me, but I don't think the social _timeline_ is the best match for all my website content. I may occasionally [syndicate](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) notes in the future, and I'll happily still support [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS).

## A more "professional" profile (whatever that means)

I wrote a [short ramble on identity and professionalism](/posts/2024-short-ramble-on-blog-names.html) earlier this year, and am still ruminating about splitting my "fun" bloggy persona and having a businessy website for doing businessy things. I have a bunch of colleagues and comrades who have been laid off or who are currently looking for work, and I wonder if I'd be better served by a more streamlined r√©sum√© style homepage and a few case studies, should I find myself in a similar situation. This site started out as a portfolio, after all. If I go this route, I will still find ways to embrace the weird and wonderful "indie web" ethos.

## Other misc. notes

I wrote a little about [what I'm looking for in web publishing tools](/posts/2024-tool-u-want.html) this summer. I'm trying some new stuff out, but also a bit tempted to go the [Louie Mantia route of making a damn website](https://lmnt.me/blog/how-to-make-a-damn-website.html), writing a bunch of HTML documents by hand. I've used Squarespace, GitHub Pages, Netlify<sup><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup>, and now WordPress to power this website. I **will not** be moving toward anything where the _modus operandi_ is "market dominance"<sup><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup>. A diversity of platforms makes for a healthy www.

I'm looking for a pretty stable/boring tech stack that will make it easy for me to: control all the HTML and CSS; have some power over the URL structure; and make things otherwise portable for my fickle brain. If you have thoughts or suggestions, my comments are open. Or you can [reply by email](mailto:nick@nicksimson.com).

I'm aware of [Cool URIs](https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI). While no one's ever accused of me being cool<sup><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup>, I will be intentional about setting up redirects and archiving my stuff.
