This week I've seen a number of people link to what looks like a promising new API service (and WordPress plugin) to automatically update your `robots.txt` file as more and more unwanted chatbots and data scrapers come online.

I may sign up for an account and install the plugin on my WordPress sites. There's little we can do (right now) as website owners beyond a defensive `robots.txt` and [I've been interested in protecting the sites](/notes/2024-03-15-crawlers-revisited.html) I maintain from this kind of data-scraping. What's holding me back from a full-throated endorsement of the service is the name: [Dark Visitors](https://darkvisitors.com). It doesn't help that these two words are in bold 160px type in my browser window, either.

More than a decade ago, Harry Brignull coined the phrase "[dark patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_pattern)" in the user experience world, and recently changed the name of his book, initiative, and website to [Deceptive \[Design\] Patterns](https://www.deceptive.design/).

[Deceptive Patterns - About Us](https://www.deceptive.design/about-us):

> This website was previously called darkpatterns.org and the category of deceptive design practice was referred to as “dark patterns”. Under advice from Kaushalya Gupta and the Tech Policy Design Lab of the World Wide Web Foundation, the name was changed to deceptive.design and the term was changed to “deceptive patterns”. The change reflects a commitment to avoiding language that might inadvertently carry negative associations or reinforce harmful stereotypes.

I supported the name change at the time and see at as a valuable course correction. I ceased using the phrase “dark patterns” as the word “deceptive” is even more accurate and descriptive. Today, when you browse the Deceptive Patterns website, there's always the "also known as 'dark patterns'" in parentheses, kind of like an "X, formerly known as Twitter" situation. Since it was in usage for over a decade among UX practitioners and tech reporters, the old neologism is still sticky.

I do not intend this post as a public criticism of the creators behind **darkvisitors.com**, or their motives. I just hate to see them in the same English language pitfall: equating the word "dark" for "bad" (and in this case "nonhuman"). There’s a great WordPress plugin that used to be called “Block Bad Queries”, now “[BBQ Firewall](https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-bad-queries/).” That’s kind of clever… It's unfortunate the domain **block.ai** was already taken (and redirects to some kind of Web3 wallet thingy), because that could have been a good alternative name for a technical intervention like this.

Some may ridicule this as being "politically correct" or oversensitive. Setting my politics aside, I’ll own up to being a sensitive person. While there are bigger structural changes we have to make to advance a more inclusive and equitable world, words still matter.
