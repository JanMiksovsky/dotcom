I don't have a lot of insights on my reading habits from this past year. I notice I can handle one book in each format (physical, ebook, audio) at a time. Any more is too much mental switching for me. Long books take a long time to finish. I had a bunch of books I did not finish last year, or haven't finished yet.

I'd like to take a little more time and use a little more space on my blog throughout the year to reflect on what I'm reading. _Why did I pick up a particular book? What did I enjoy/not enjoy? What challenged or expanded my thinking? Why do I endorse this title?_

Here's what I managed to finish reading in 2023.
