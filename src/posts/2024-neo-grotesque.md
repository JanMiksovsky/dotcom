![Day 14: Neo-Grotesque](images/26Days-N-NeoGrotesque-1024x576.png)

Welcome to the 14th installment of [26 Days of Type](https://nicksimson.com/26-days-of-type/). And Happy Valentine's Day! I thought it might be appropriate today to open with a sonnet, and who better to write a love poem to this "coldest", most "sterile" of typeface genres, than ChatGPT?

> In fonts austere, their love does thrive,  
> Neo-Grotesque, where clean lines strive.  
> In Helvetica's grip, Univers does jive,  
> Their bond serene, in typographic hive.
> 
> No ornamentation, no extravagant hue,  
> Each character precise, in its rigid milieu.  
> No fancy curves, no embellishment true,  
> Their passion restrained, in a minimalist view.
> 
> In stark embrace, they share their domain,  
> No excess here, in this textual terrain.  
> Their love in simplicity, an unadorned refrain,  
> Yet in their austerity, a beauty plain.
> 
> So here's to Helvetica, to Univers fair,  
> In fonts austere, their love they bear.
> 
> Love poem to Univers & Helvetica, written by ChatGPT

I've featured a number of Grotesque typefaces so far in this series, including [Epilogue](https://nicksimson.com/posts/epilogue/), [Franklin Gothic](https://nicksimson.com/posts/franklin/), [Halyard](https://nicksimson.com/posts/halyard/), and [Karla](https://nicksimson.com/posts/karla/). Today I'm taking a look at a sub-classification of this genre, the Neo-Grotesque.

The most famous example is [Helvetica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helvetica), which you might recognize from the [NYC Subway system](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262015486/helvetica-and-the-new-york-city-subway-system/), Target, Jeep, Toyota, Knoll, Crate&Barrel, JCPenney, [U.S. Federal tax forms](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1040gi.pdf), the [U.S. National Park System](https://www.nps.gov/parkhistory/online_books/brochures/unigrid/index.htm), [Chuck Klosterman's book covers](https://literal.club/author/chuck-klosterman-uzzfo), and a [2007 documentary film](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0847817/) of the same name.

[Univers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Univers) was the official typeface of the state university I attended ([still is](https://nau.edu/visual-identity-guide/typography/)!). I used this typeface a lot as an intern in the marketing and communications office. I avoided it for my student projects, and while I admire and respect [Adrian Frutiger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Frutiger), I haven't really touched Univers since those days.

1957 is an important year in typographic history, being when these two typefaces (and [Folio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folio_(typeface)) as well!) were released, ushering in the International (or "Swiss") Typographic Style. These designs draw inspiration from Berthold's [Akzidenz Grotesk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akzidenz-Grotesk), a typeface released at the end of the 19th Century. Neo-Grotesques feature low-contrast stokes and usually tall [x-heights](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/x_height). Instead of "true italics", these fonts often have sloped, angled forms called _obliques_. Because of the consistency of form and uniformity in detail, Neo-Grotesques are said to take on a "neutral" appearance.

If you've used [Arial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arial) on the web, in an email, or a document, you know the Neo-Grotesque genre. Everyone has a version of this typeface. In 2014, Monotype began redrawing and rebuilding Helvetica from the ground up in a new version called [Helvetica® Now](https://www.monotype.com/fonts/helvetica-now). Apple uses its own [San Francisco](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/) font in its operating systems. VICE and CNN both have their own proprietary versions now.

[Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto), [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter), and [Manrope](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Manrope) are all examples of Neo-Grotesques you can find and use on Google Fonts (or Bunny CDN). Adobe Fonts has [Acumin](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/acumin) by Adobe, [Aktiv Grotesk](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/aktiv-grotesk) by Dalton Maag, plus revivals of [Neue Haas Grotesk](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/neue-haas-grotesk) and [Neue Haas Unica](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/neue-haas-unica).

If you can't get enough of this genre, independent type designers have their own Neo-Grotesques, too. Swiss foundry Optimo has [Theinhardt](https://optimo.ch/typefaces/theinhardt), released in 2009. Kris Sowersby released [Untitled Sans](https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/untitled-sans/) in 2017 and [Söhne](https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/soehne/) in 2019, both through Klim Type Foundry. Ty Finck created his own, "better Helvetica", [Def Sans](https://tyfromtheinternet.com/shop/defsans/), released in 2023.

## When should I use a Neo-Grotesque?

I don't want to say these are neutral or unopinionated, because something like Helvetica, which as been around for 60+ years, has plenty of cultural baggage. All typefaces have personality. That said, the uniformity and lack of idiosyncrasy of the shapes in a Neo-Grotesque might be more appealing for certain contexts, compared to [grotesques](https://fonts.ilovetypography.com/category/grotesque) or [humanist sans-serifs](https://fonts.ilovetypography.com/category/humanist-sans).

I would choose very carefully whether you are setting type at a body or text size, or for a headline. I think Helvetica has been redesigned so many times because of its [legibility issues at text sizes](https://medium.com/@msilvertant/why-is-helvetica-bad-e6b281672ee3). UI fonts like San Francisco and Inter are optimized for legibility, but don't look stellar (in my opinion) at large display sizes. Early in my design education and career, I found Univers a better option for both text and display. These days I'd reach for a family with a rage of [optical sizes](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/optical_sizes) (micro, text, and display).
