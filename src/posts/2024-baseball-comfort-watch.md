_In reply to [Looking for a comfort watch? Turn on baseball, our pop culture critic says](https://www.npr.org/2024/07/16/nx-s1-5040530/summer-baseball-all-star-game) by Linda Holmes (NPR)._

I used to find it interesting and entertaining to follow politics. Then... that kind of stopped being fun. Now I follow baseball.

After reading [Susan's note](https://www.susanjeanrobertson.com/notes/mlb-stats/) and [Gregory's post](https://gregorygross.com/blog/entry.php?id=2023121500) about streaming baseball last year, I decided to get the MLB At Bat subscription, which lets me listen to every single regular season MLB radio broadcast. I think it costs around 30 dollars. I actually listen to baseball games on the radio almost every day of the week. When the Amazin' New York Mets are playing in the MLB.tv [Free Game of the Day](https://www.mlb.com/live-stream-games/free-game-of-the-day), I tune in to that (I'll be watching the Mets play the Braves on Sunday, 7/28).

I agree with almost every part of [Linda's endorsement](https://www.npr.org/2024/07/16/nx-s1-5040530/summer-baseball-all-star-game), except for the Phillies section. If you want to jump on a bandwagon because a writer at NPR convinced you, go for it. But 162 3-4 hour games each year is a huge commitment. If you don't already have a MLB team to follow, you should **make your own decision**. Here are a few different strategies for picking a baseball team:

1. Read up on all 30 clubs and their histories. Wikipedia is great for this. You're making a huge time commitment anyway. Go on the subreddits of teams you _think_ you want to follow and see what those fans are really like.

3. Go with the team of a close friend or beloved family member. This will give you something to watch together and something new to make your relationship closer.

5. Pick a team based on a city or place you have an affinity for. It could be somewhere you grew up, dreamed of living, or love to visit. The great thing about this: once you're in town during the summer, you can actually go to the game!

7. Make sure you can actually watch some games. Blackouts are a thing, and [Bally Sports/Diamond Sports really screwed over thousands of fans in local television markets](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/mlb/news/comcast-bally-sports-blackout-diamond-sports-group-contract/8257d85ba2813ea473b8b429) recently. I really hope this issue gets fixed, for the sake of the fans and the future of the game itself.

9. I personally think the National League clubs (Dodgers, Giants, Pirates, Padres, Brewers, etc.) are more _fun_ overall. I'll make an exception for the Minnesota Twins, who [celebrate a night honoring Prince](https://www.mlb.com/twins/tickets/specials/prince-night) every year.

11. The New York Yankees are like the Evil Empire from _Star Wars_. No beards; no mascots; [no alternate uniforms](https://fansided.com/2023/06/23/will-yankees-city-connect-uniform/), really. I'm not saying you _shouldn't_ pick the Yankees; these are just things you should keep in mind in case you happen to like _fun_.

13. Look up some [Hall of Famers](https://baseballhall.org/hall-of-fame/hall-of-fame-explorer). Maybe you identify with a single player more than a team. Who did they play for? Whose hat are they wearing on the plaque? If you adore [Ken Griffey Jr.](https://baseballhall.org/hall-of-famers/griffey-jr-ken), you should probably be a Mariners fan.

Let's Go Mets! ⚾
