Finished reading: _[Doppelganger: A Trip into the Mirror World](https://bookshop.org/p/books/doppelganger-a-trip-into-the-mirror-world-naomi-klein/20025222?ean=9780374610326)_ by Naomi Klein, ISBN: 9781039006904

What would you do if you were constantly being mistaken for someone else? And that someone else started developing more paranoid, dangerous, poisonous views diametrically opposed to your own?

I spend a considerable amount of time thinking about identity, as someone who has multiple domains registered under my first and last name. I'm maintaining a [fragmented online presence across several networks](/links.html), trying to be in control of my own narrative. I even have a graphic mark (a _logo_ or _brand_) representing myself in the top left corner of this website.

25 years after publishing a [book on corporate identity](https://naomiklein.org/no-logo/), it only seems appropriate that Naomi Klein would eventually tackle the complicated facets of our personal identities. This is indeed Klein's most personal work to date, but _Doppelganger_ is much more than a memoir.

Spurred on by her own personal branding crisis, Klein follows the public trajectory of her doppelganger, Naomi Wolf (another middle aged author in North America with the same first name) from liberal feminist to right-wing conspiracist. Klein explores what she calls the "mirror world," an alternate (broadcast and social) media ecosystem devoted to parallel realities:

> At first, I thought what I was seeing in my doppelganger’s world was mostly grifting unbound. Over time, though, I started to get the distinct impression that I was also witnessing a new and dangerous political formation find itself in real time: its alliances, worldview, slogans, enemies, code words, and no-go zones—and, most of all, its ground game for taking power.

After tracing a similar trajectory of wellness influencer to anti-vaxxer pipeline, I was particularly moved by Klein's more personal chapter about her own child on the autistic spectrum, and her encounter with the troubling history of this diagnosis. The shared Jewish identity of the two Naomis serves as a foundation for a later chapter about Israel and Palestine, which turns out to be very timely reading in late 2023.

I picked up _Doppelganger_ on the heels of finishing Jeff Sharlet's _[The Undertow: Scenes from a Slow Civil War](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-undertow-scenes-from-a-slow-civil-war-jeff-sharlet/18515351?ean=9781324006497)_. Sharlet examines some similar territory on a road trip across the U.S. meeting with true believers occupying a different reality from his. He went looking for the [alternate American flags](https://popula.com/2019/02/24/about-face/) and found Trump supporters who believe the 2020 election was "stolen", militia types in the heartland, men's rights activists, Christian nationalist pastors, and anyone else willing to talk to a journalist with a notebook.

Two years ago, I published "[Different realities](/posts/2021-different-realities.html)", after hearing my mom and dad parroting some troubling talking points from some questionable online influencers. I suspected they had fallen into a mirror world themselves. We're coming up on the second anniversary of [my dad's death](/posts/2021-boone.html) this week. Almost as hard as not being able to say goodbye to him, was knowing the deep fear he was feeling about events that seemed beyond his control.

I'm not trying to convert my mom to my political beliefs, but I haven't given up on trying to show her that we live in a shared reality. Maybe your family or neighbors are divided on something similar (real or imagined), too. Instead of constantly arguing or fact-checking, I have spent the last couple years trying to understand how people fall into rabbit holes or adopt fringe beliefs. The consequences of failing to understand seem dire. I recommend both Klein's and Sharlet's latest books to anyone else trying to make sense of this current moment.
