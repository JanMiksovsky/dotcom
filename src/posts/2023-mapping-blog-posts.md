_Bookmarked [Travelers' Map](https://wordpress.org/plugins/travelers-map/) by Camille Verrier._

Travelers' Map looks like a nifty [WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/travelers-map/). I've been interested in adding some location-based functionality to my site, mainly with my posts and notes that are using location based [tags](/tags/), or the Places category.

Now that it is not terribly hot in the Southwest, I'm itchy to travel a bit locally and explore our new home some more. We got back from Arizona this past weekend, and travel with a toddler is not much fun at all. But long term, I'd like to document more of my travels and discoveries with my blog. I've especially been thinking of ways to showcase my "place posts" on an interactive map, and this could be one possible solution.

The plugin uses Leaflet and OpenStreetMap data, which I'm familiar with from using [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) a few years ago. You can see this in action on Camille's own [hiking blog](https://camilles-travels.com/la-carte/).

I should also look into the IndieWeb [checkin](https://indieweb.org/checkin) and [venue](https://indieweb.org/venue) concepts a bit more, and see how others are doing this kind of thing on their personal sites. I particularly like the way Jeremy Keith [displays a map for each of his checkins](https://adactio.com/notes/checkins), and Katy DeCorah displays a map (almost as an art direction feature) around the post title with [her adventures](https://katydecorah.com/adventures/).

I'll plan a fall weekend afternoon to install the plugin and play around with this idea some more. In the meantime, I have events like the [International Balloon Fiesta](https://balloonfiesta.com/) plus a [solar eclipse](https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2023/) to look forward to.
