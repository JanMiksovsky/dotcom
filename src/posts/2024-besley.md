Welcome to day two of [#26DaysOfType](/26-days-of-type.html). Today's featured font is [Besley\*](https://indestructibletype.com/Besley.html). Owen Earl, the typeface designer behind Besley\* puts an asterisk next to his font names as a kind of branding or distinction for designs released under his foundry, [Indestructible Type](https://indestructibletype.com/Home.html).

Besley\* is a revival of a design called Clarendon. It is also the font I chose for the headings on my website (I use the 500 or Medium weight).

 <blockquote>
  <p>Clarendon is an English slab-serif typeface that was created in England by Robert Besley for the Fann Street Foundry in 1845. Besley went as far as trying to patent the typeface, and Clarendon is now known as the first registered typeface. However, the patents at the time lasted only three years; as soon as the typeface became popular, it was copied by other foundries. The original matrices and punches remained at Stephenson Blake and later resided at the Type Museum, London. They were marketed by Stephenson Blake as Consort, though some additional weights (a bold and italics) were cut in the 1950s.</p>
  <p>It was named after the Clarendon Press in Oxford. The typeface was reworked by the Monotype foundry in 1935. It was revised by Hermann Eidenbenz in 1953.</p>

With Besley\*, Owen Earl set out to create a version of Clarendon to fit the needs of 21st century typesetting. Besley\* looks great on screens and in print and features beautiful original italics drawn from the ground up.

When it comes to typeface classification, this type of font is called a _slab-serif_, _Egyptian_, or _Clarendon_. Since there are many typefaces using the name Clarendon, including Robert Besley's original design, I avoid using "Clarendon" as a catch-all for this genre. Similarly, the connection between these fonts and Egypt is murky, so I prefer **slab-serif**. The hyphenation is yet another idiosyncratic preference. Here's [Google Fonts' Glossary](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/slab_serif_egyptian_clarendon), for some helpful nuance:

> “Slab Serif” walks an interesting line between being another historical [classification](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/classification) and a wider genre of typefaces, arguably on par with both serif and sans serif. And don’t be fooled by its name: Most slabs are closer to sans serifs than serifs, usually with a relatively [monolinear](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/monolinear) or unmodulated stroke. In [superfamilies](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/superfamily) that contain serifs, sans serifs, and slab serifs, you’ll often notice that the skeletal structure of the sans and slab is far closer.
> 
> The sub-genre of Clarendons is perhaps an exception, where there’s a smoother flow from the letterforms into the slabs themselves, and more overall contrast in the strokes.

## Where to use Besley\*

- Branding for something outdoorsy; this has big U.S. National Park vibes.
- Anywhere you want to appear warm, timeless, understated.
- Large headings and blockquotes evocative of mid 20th century jazz albums and paperback covers.
