On opening day, I checked in with my neighbor across the street to see how he was feeling about the upcoming baseball season. T is the biggest Cubs fan I‚Äôve ever met, and he‚Äôs not even from Chicago. Big Cubs logo flag flying over his garage. Rarely seen outdoors without a Cubs hat on. He has a vanity license plate broadcasting his fandom to the state of New Mexico, too.

‚ÄúThe Mets are a good team,‚Äù T said, acknowledging the orange interlocking N.Y. on my own cap. His voice sounded sincere.

I was a baseball fan as a kid, and just got more *casual* about it after moving from New York as a teen, discovering new interests, following other sports. I got back into baseball *hard* this year, though, listening to almost every Mets broadcast each week through the spring, summer, and now October. It‚Äôs true: the recent rule changes in the MLB have made the game better, overall.

I‚Äôve had a tumultuous few years. In one year of the global pandemic I lost six family members. Including my own dad. Then my daughter was born. A few months later, I started a new job. And several months into that, I moved to another city, state, and time zone. *No new changes, please* has been my mantra for the last year.

Following baseball‚Äìspecifically the New York Mets‚Äìgave me a reprieve from the pressures as a worker and a parent, for a couple hours every night. I was not actively avoiding or running from those responsibilities. Just enjoying the sounds of the bat, the crowd, and Howie Rose‚Äôs play-by-play and random trivia.

My highlights of the season were [Luis Torrens‚Äô game-winning double play in the London series](https://www.mlb.com/video/luis-torrens-wins-play-of-the-week-with-double-play); [sweeping all four games against the Yankees](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5595832/2024/06/27/mets-sweep-yankees-subway-series-500-again/); and of course the [first game of the last double-header](https://www.mlb.com/video/game/747139) against the Braves in Atlanta. There were some low, low points this season, chief among them [Jorge L√≥pez getting ejected from the May 29th game](https://www.mlb.com/video/jorge-lopez-gets-ejected?q=Jorge%20Lopez&cp=CMS_FIRST&qt=FREETEXT&p=0) and getting tossed by the Mets the next day.

In my narrative of the season, it was [Francisco Lindor‚Äôs called players-only meeting](https://www.si.com/mlb/mets/news/new-york-mets-star-francisco-lindor-explains-why-he-called-team-meeting-logan9) that catalyzed the turnaround in June, and made this postseason appearance possible. Lindor will be my MVP for this year, and its a shame he wasn‚Äôt selected to play in the All-Star Game. The Mets were fun to watch in the regular season, and were fun in the postseason too. I didn‚Äôt want them to have to face the L.A. Dodgers in the National League Championship Series, but the Mets put up a fight, making that series last 6 games. Well, it‚Äôs only 157 days until Opening Day 2025. Ya Gotta Believe!

Tipping my Mets cap to everyone who enhanced my enjoyment of this year‚Äôs unforgettable baseball season:

- Rookie manager Carlos Mendoza. There were plenty of moments I questioned what he was doing, but often he was doing the right thing. This guy is playing chess.
- The entire roster of guys, but especially Franciscos Alvarez and Lindor, Pete Alonso, Brandon Nimmo, Jos√© ‚Äú[Candelita](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRzHD9i6CKQ)‚Äù Iglesias, Sean Manaea, Edwin D√≠az, and Mark Vientos. Lots of positive energy on this year‚Äôs team.
- Allison, Maggie, and Linda from [A Pod of Their Own](https://www.homerunapplesauce.com/a-pod-of-their-own).
- Samantha and Ashley (in Syracuse!) from [Why Am I a Mets Fan](https://www.youtube.com/@WhyMetsPod)?
- Jane, Lauren, and Stephen from the [Batting Around podcast](https://www.patreon.com/battingaround) (to keep up with the rest of MLB).
- [Seymour Weiner](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5446444/2024/04/25/mets-seymour-weiner-hot-dog/), who kinda kicked off this season of vibes.
- üíú Grimace!
- Devin Gordon, whose book I finally read.
- Howie Rose and Keith Raad on 880 AM.
- Gary, Keith, and Ron on SNY.
