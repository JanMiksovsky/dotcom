I don’t have any great insights into my reading list in 2024. Most of the books on this list have been in my “want-to-read” list for some time. Others were impulse books I picked up on a whim.

Every year I put this list together, I find myself wishing I read more books. My attention felt so fragmented in 2024, and in 2025 I will be taking some steps to reclaim more of my time and attention.

Here’s a guide to the emoji in this post:
