[Vice News: What it's like to be the target of a COVID conspiracy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEmn\_o3tnrc)

This one really pissed me off. Three pretty ordinary people (a prop artist, a molecular biology professor and a physician) had their names, images and likenesses swiped in the service of COVID-19 conspiracy claims. Three ordinary people just using the internet to conduct and publish their research, to entertain, or to connect with others.

After my wife and I had a miscarriage earlier this year, Dr. Rockwell's story in particular makes me pretty furious. People post publicly about their vaccination statuses in an effort to encourage others to get the jab. People post publicly about their pregnancy loss in an effort to de-stigmatize something that [a lot of people go through](https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/early-pregnancy-loss), but not a lot of people feel comfortable talking about. Dr. Rockwell could very easily be any number of women we know.

I get disgusted knowing that some anonymous people are making money by deceiving others. They are also leading people to an early, preventable death or infecting others during a global pandemic. Furthermore, this behavior gets rewarded by social media companies in the form of likes, shares and other engagement metrics.
