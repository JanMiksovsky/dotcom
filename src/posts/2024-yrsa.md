![Day 25: Yrsa](images/26Days-Y-Yrsa-1024x576.png)

[Yrsa and Rasa](https://github.rosettatype.com/yrsa-rasa/) are open-source typefaces released by Rosetta Type. Yrsa is a Latin script typeface supporting over 300 languages. Rasa is a Gujarati script typeface supporting 3 languages (Gujarati, Kachchi, Avestan). Both are available as variable fonts supporting italic (Latin only) and weight axes. The design and production on these typefaces was completed by Anna Giedryś and David Březina at Rosetta.

The Yrsa Latin script is based on Merriweather, another open source typeface, while the Rasa Gujarati script is based on Skolar Gujarati, another Rosetta type release. The main difference between Yrsa and Merriweather are the shapes of some lowercase characters: Yrsa's lowercase **a** has a shorter _bowl_ and lowercase **r** has a little spur descending from its _shoulder_. Certain lowercase glyphs and ampersands take on a different appearance in the italic styles. Finally, Merriweather's default numerals are old-style figures, while Yrsa's are lining figures.
