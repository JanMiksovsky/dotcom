![Day 29: Bonus, Bonus Day!](/img/post-images/26Days-29-1024x576.png)

It's the real, real end of [26 Days of Type](https://nicksimson.com/26-days-of-type/). I really don’t know how to close out the last day of a month-long daily writing and publishing challenge.

I feel like I said what I wanted to say about the project in [Tuesday’s post](https://nicksimson.com/posts/a-font-is-a-personal-thing/) and it made for a good conclusion. Then there was the matter of extra days to fulfill. Maybe I won't even write about type at all tonight.

I did think it would be a fun challenge to write about some CSS typesetting stuff, especially with browser support for recent properties that I couldn’t have imagined a decade ago. I got a lot of encouragement and interest from a few people I talked about this topic with early on. Maybe that post (or series) will come along some day.

The time it took to research and put together a little CodePen demo for [Drop Caps](https://nicksimson.com/posts/drop-caps/) almost tanked me on day four. Actually it was a family trip to the emergency room that day (everyone's fine now). I think the more technical kind of writing and editing just takes me a bit longer than I have to squeeze in for a daily project[1](#9fb52aa9-c738-4656-ba4e-c27e6fc1f22b). I have my full time job, plus a toddler, another human adult, and a dog that all seem to like my attention. Not to mention the time it takes to feed, clean up after, and otherwise maintain oneself.

Speaking of that toddler, what has been kind of serendipitous this February is her developing interest and awareness of the alphabet. Early this month I was writing with bath crayons on her tub's walls, and she shouted “ABCs!” Now she's beginning to sing her way through “The Alphabet Song.” How kids pick up language at this age is fascinating to me, and these little details make for a fun coincidence as my own mind has been preoccupied with letters and alphabets this month.

I mentioned [Wiggle Work](https://wiggle.work/) a few times in this series, and I want to give a special shout out and “thank you” to the four other folks who have been writing daily and encouraging each other in our little Discord channel:

- [Jeff](https://micro.webology.dev/archive/)
- [Joni](https://www.breakfastletters.com/archives)
- [Matt](https://garden.mattstein.com/notes)
- [Sarah](https://www.sarahgebauer.com/post/)

While our Winter Writing Workshop has drawn to a close, I hope even more of us can continue to share ideas, drafts and posts throughout the year.

Well, it’s before midnight here in the mountains of the American Southwest. _I made it!_
