![Day 8: Halyard Family](images/26Days-H-Halyard-1024x576.png)

[Halyard](https://www.dardenstudio.com/halyard) is a family of [grotesque sans-serifs](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/grotesque_neo_grotesque) in three optical sizes: Display, Text and Micro. The type family was conceived by Joshua Darden, with design contributions by Eben Sorkin and Lucas Sharp. The typeface was released in 2017 by Darden Studio.

> Halyard radically extends the typographic utility of the now hyper ubiquitous category: the Grotesque Sans. Halyard’s personality is at once familiar and pleasingly distinctive. The Halyard superfamily is beautifully robust and lively, ready to work at any size. While starkly different in appearance, Halyard’s optical subfamilies perform with consistent personality at their intended sizes — creating the impression of single type design.

The **Q** and **R** characters in Halyard Display are particularly arresting.

Rather than being a revival of any particular 19th or 20th century grotesque, Halyard references various typefaces of this era into an original design, and draws inspiration from some surprising sources. [The Display version of Halyard was inspired by a road sign](https://eyeondesign.aiga.org/halyard-a-font-family-drawn-for-both-independence-and-harmony/) in Brooklyn and Darden's team of designers also studied hand-carved lettering on graves in the northeastern U.S. in the process of making the type family.

The Display family comes in nice, tight letterspacing, especially in the heavier weights. You'll get that [NYC Subway Helvetica](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262015486/helvetica-and-the-new-york-city-subway-system/) look, without it being Helvetica. If you are putting together a book or similar typographic system, you could use Halyard throughout, in the correct optical sizes, and you'd be in great shape. But things get interesting once you start breaking the rules. And Halyard Micro's [ink traps](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/ink_trap) (especially the numerals) lend themselves to some expressive shapes at larger sizes.[1](#a5411328-f9d2-4c2e-974b-316fee7e432f)

Halyard Micro was built for small text sizes, but does some surprising things when you use it for titles and other big text.

> Halyard communicates a clear vision of — and a strong opinion about — how to design for optical sizes in the twenty-first century. Appearing to balance effortlessly between utility and expressiveness, combining usefulness with quirkiness, is, I guess, every type designer’s ultimate goal.

Sadly, I haven't used Halyard much before putting together the images for this blog post today. And that's a shame. I'm enjoying the family's character, and I want to spend much more time with it.

There's been a glut of [products using Windsor](https://www.typewolf.com/windsor) and similar funky serif typefaces recently, that the pendulum should be swinging toward more quirky and expressive grotesques, like Halyard. But I only notice trends, I don't forecast them. Halyard might very well have arrived in time, but the world hasn't caught up to it yet.

## Pair this with...

[Jubilat](https://www.dardenstudio.com/typefaces/jubilat) or [Freight Text](https://freightcollection.com/freight-text/), both by Joshua Darden. It's never lazy to pair two fonts by the same designer. I'd use Jubilat for headings (by now you know how much I love a slab serif) with Halyard Text. Or Halyard Display with Freight Text[2](#03cbd74e-3ca9-48cb-9b1e-72919ddeea2e). And if you're developing an extensive type system, you could get _extra freaky_ combining Halyard Micro with [Freight Micro](https://freightcollection.com/freight-micro/). If you're paying for Adobe Creative Cloud, you're already getting all these fonts. Put them to use!
