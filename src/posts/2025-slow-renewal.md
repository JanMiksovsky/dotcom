It is warming up here in New Mexico, and I am thinking about the flowers I want to put in my garden. The new Gambel oak we planted in the fall is sprouting new green leaves, and we are opening the windows in the house to let the fresh air in.

As the season has changed to spring, I also feel the need to bring my blog out of hibernation. The last long-form entry I managed to publish was February 22nd. About two months, and at least four constitutional crises ago. A two months lapse should not be a big deal, and at the same time I’ve noticed my activity on social sites like Mastodon and Bluesky slowing down.

Blog posts about the frequency of publishing (or not posting) are the _absolute worst_, and that's not what I'm trying to do here. I promise.

If a RSS feed goes a month without updates, or a social feed goes quiet for a week without warning, do you assume the worst about its creator (they’re dead)? Or can you assume the best (they are getting outside and living life to its fullest)?

A combination of writer’s block and a hesitancy to hit publish has gotten to me in the last several weeks. The news cycle has been a flurry of bullshit and cruelty for several weeks. A number of sites and accounts I follow have pivoted to becoming Current Events accounts. I have no disdain or anything for this kind of change. There’s plenty to be righteously outraged about these days and a lot of legacy media has fallen down at the job. We will always need voices making sense of the events in our time.

While I am not adverse to writing about [current events](/tags/currents.html) from time to time, I am not ready to pivot this website into becoming a full-time Current Events Blog. In the face of all the ongoing bullshit and cruelty, writing mundane blog posts and amplifying trivial, status quo content doesn’t feel right to me either. I'm reading other blogs for a human perspective, an **actual point of view**, and trying to make sure mine reads like that as well.

I've been hitting the books a bit more lately. Trying to get to the meaty, meaningful stuff that's been on my to-read list for a while, and do some deeper, critical reading. It's been a while since I did a book report post on my site, and I'd like to get back to doing that again. The last book I finished was <i>Acid West</i>, a series of essays by Joshua Wheeler about Southern New Mexico, a marginalized and often overlooked place. Soon I will be finishing <i>Society of the Spectacle</i>, a work of critical theory by Guy Debord. I'd love to share my reading notes with you, dear reader.

My website has felt at its most healthy (that's to say I've felt at my healthiest) when I'm writing and publishing one or two longer form posts per month, and three or four shorter notes per week. As I slowly get back to this cadence, my renewed focus is making my writing more independent and humane.
