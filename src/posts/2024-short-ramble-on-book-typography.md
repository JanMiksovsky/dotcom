My spouse was reading an older book set in [ITC Korinna](https://www.myfonts.com/collections/korinna-font-itc), a very 1970s/80s design. [If you've watched Jeopardy!, you've seen this font](https://fontsinuse.com/uses/5507/jeopardy-game-show), or at least the uppercase letters.

If I saw a page typeset in one of the [Rotis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotis) fonts, I’d place that firmly in the late 1990s or early 00s.

I think I have a curse. For years I tuned my eye to carefully recognize the shapes that make an [Optima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optima) or a [Bodoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodoni) and now I'm afraid I can't read like a normal person anymore.

For me, typeface like Korinna and Rotis feel dated and I keep getting distracted by the shapes of the letters. The reading I do in a book is very different from reading a website, versus reading a book on an eReader.

On a website I find myself zooming in if the text is too small, or sometimes switching to a reader mode if the design is hindering the reading process. I've been using the [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com) app for ages, and am accustomed to reading everything in the beautiful [Lyon](https://commercialtype.com/catalog/lyon) typeface from Commercial Type. My preferred ebook reader is the Books app on iOS, and I toggle between [Athelas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athelas_(typeface)) and [Iowan Old Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowan_Old_Style) for comfortable reading. The Kindle font [Bookerly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookerly) is also quite good (I use the Kindle app for iOS when I have no other way to read a book).

If I'm reading a paperback or hardcover, and the type is not a [Baskerville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baskerville), [Bembo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bembo), [Caslon,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caslon) [Garamond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garamond), or [Plantin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantin_(typeface)) based design, it might feel dated or novel. I thought about this personal phenomena a lot while writing the [Old Style](/posts/2024-old-style.html) and [Transitional](/posts/2024-transitional.html) installments in my blogging series. These days, not every book includes the name of the typeface its set in, so its hard for me to identify exactly what a book is typeset in.

Did book designers get better at choosing type in the last 20 years? Or just safer, more conservative? The book serifs that are widely used today all feel like classic choices and rarely distract me from the reading process.
