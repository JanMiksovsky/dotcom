I'm sure you've seen this one. Maybe on a poster or a magazine headline. Or in the Windows 95 font menu. The [MoMA logotype](https://bpando.org/2020/01/02/moma-by-order/) is based on it. It's named after Benjamin Franklin, the most famous printer in American history.

Sometimes, a classic can't be beat. But it can be perfected.

- There are many more versions that have (and haven't) been digitized, and some that are not even available to license.

## Why are there so many versions?

The short answer is technology. Franklin Gothic was designed by Morris Fuller Benton at American Type Founders, and was originally released in the early 1900s as metal type. [Phototypesetting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phototypesetting), [Letraset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letraset), and later desktop publishing (and all its various font formats) required new versions of these fonts to be redrawn. Different companies in different parts of the world have had the license to this type from ATF. Every designer who touched this typeface was looking to improve with new widths and weights, while remaining true to the spirit of Benton's original design.

Years before digital typesetting, here's how ITC Franklin Gothic was marketed in 1980. [View the publication on the Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/ulc-magazine/Volume%207-1/mode/2up).

That said, there are some subtle differences between these different versions. The ITC version of Franklin Gothic "Helvetica-ized" the transitions between stems and arches, whereas Benton's original design for ATF featured more contrast and sharper transitions. The _ear_ in the lowercase **g** in ITC version is bigger and more pronounced.

![HEX Franklin compared to Libre Franklin. Libre is quite soft and round compared to HEX](images/26Days-F-Franklin-Glyphic-1024x576.png)

The [Libre Franklin](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Franklin) version is a bit softer and more rounded than any of the other versions listed above, almost as if a rounded stroke was applied to the letterforms. Once you see it, its kind of hard to unsee. If you must use this free version, I'm sure it's OK at text sizes. But out of respect for Mr. Benton, use something else at 24px and above.

## Where should I use Franklin?

Franklin is a quintessentially American typeface. As I mentioned earlier, MoMA uses this font, their own proprietary version. So does _The New York Times_. Franklin was used extensively through the 20th century American visual landscape for a variety of uses. Looks great in all caps, or with tight letterspacing, or both. It's a pretty rugged and utilitarian sans-serif, but versatile too. It rarely looks dated. One type designer has compared Franklin to blue jeans, in that way.

If you can't get enough Franklin and type history, make sure you don't miss Nick Sherman's talk, [Franklin Gothic Goes On Forever](https://coopertype.org/events/franklin_gothic_goes_on_forever). Sherman is the designer behind [HEX Franklin](https://hex.xyz/HEX_Franklin/), and a self-proclaimed "Franklin Gothic Monster".
