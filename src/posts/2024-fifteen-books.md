_In reply to [15 Books with the Most Impact | Living Out Loud](https://louplummer.lol/15-books-with-the-most-impact/)._

I saw [Ben Werdmuller](https://werd.io/2024/15-books-that-made-an-impact) and [Tracy Durnell](https://tracydurnell.com/2024/07/10/re-15-books-with-the-most-impact/) each publish their list of 15 books with the most impact this week, inspired by [Lou Plummer's original list](https://louplummer.lol/15-books-with-the-most-impact/). There are some good books in these lists, and ones I'm intrigued to pick up myself. Gonna look for that Woody Guthrie biography soon...

I already maintain a [Library](https://nicksimson.com/library/) section of my website, so why not narrow this short list down to an even shorter list? Many of these books are ones I read in my teens and twenties, and are still helping me make sense of the world as I plummet into middle age.

1. **[The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York](https://bookshop.org/a/21729/9780394720241)** by Robert Caro. If you want to understand why New York City looks like it does today, this book answers almost all your questions. Required reading if you are a designer of any kind, or are interested in 20th century politics.

2. **[A Confederacy of Dunces](https://bookshop.org/a/21729/9780807159606)** by John Kennedy Toole. I've still never been to New Orleans to this day, but this literary version of the city is forever burned in my imagination. The plot is absurd, the characters outrageous, and the story of the publication of this book is just as fascinating.

3. **[James Baldwin: Collected Essays](https://search.worldcat.org/title/1138676578)**. Includes both "Notes of a Native Son" and "The Fire Next Time". Baldwin is one of the literary giants of the 20th century, and reading him helps me make sense of America today.

4. **[Understanding Comics: The Invisible Art](https://bookshop.org/a/21729/9780060976255)** by Scott McCloud. Essential reading for visual literacy and visual communication. Once upon a time I wanted to be a cartoonist. This book still informs my graphic and interaction design practice to this day.

5. **[Annals of the Former World](https://bookshop.org/a/21729/9780374518738)** by John McPhee. An inspired journey through the geology of North America. The ultimate time travel and road trip book.

6. **[Seeing is Forgetting the Name of the Thing One Sees]**(https://bookshop.org/a/21729/9780520256095) by Lawrence Weschler. One of the best books about art I've encountered. Robert Irwin is not my favorite artist, but Weschler's book made me think differently about art.

7. **[Slaughterhouse-Five](https://bookshop.org/a/21729/9780440180296)** by Kurt Vonnegut. _Cat's Cradle_ comes in a close second for my favorite Vonnegut novel.

8. **[109 East Palace: Robert Oppenheimer and the Secret City of Los Alamos](https://bookshop.org/a/21729/9780743250085)** by Jennet Conant. I haven't read _American Prometheus_, or seen _Oppenheimer_ the film yet, but the story of Los Alamos is important in my spouse's family history, and haunts my nightmares as well.

9. **[Krazy: George Herriman, a Life in Black and White](https://bookshop.org/a/21729/9780061733000)** by Michael Tisserand. The definitive biography of my favorite comics artist. An incredible story about race and art in America and hiding in plain sight.

10. **[George Grosz: An Autobiography](https://bookshop.org/a/21729/9780520213272)**. Picked this up after hearing graphic designer Paul Sahre recommend it. A firsthand account of an artist living through one of the most fascinating periods of history.

11. **[Racecraft: The Soul of Inequality in American Life](https://bookshop.org/a/21729/9781839765643)** by Karen E. Fields and Barbara J. Fields. This book informs how I understand racism, inequality, and democracy today. If you care about these things, I challenge you to wrestle with the authors' argument.

12. **[The Rest Is Noise: Listening to the Twentieth Century](https://bookshop.org/a/21729/9780312427719)** by Alex Ross. Helped me understand and appreciate music even more as a listener.

13. **[The People's Platform: Taking Back Power and Culture in the Digital Age](https://bookshop.org/a/21729/9781250062598)** by Astra Taylor. A decade old, but still instructive for anyone working in digital media today.

14. **[The Shape of Content](https://bookshop.org/a/21729/9780674805705)** by Ben Shahn. I read this as a design student in college. Really informed my thinking about visuals and communication.

15. **[Long Walk to Freedom: The Autobiography of Nelson Mandela.](https://bookshop.org/a/21729/9780316548182)** I just finished this one, and haven't gotten around to adding it to the library yet! The struggle against apartheid and for democracy in South Africa is inspiring, and the figure of Mandela looms large in my political imagination.

If you too have a list of 15 books, post it on your own website or another digital profile. I'd love to read it.
