[Rachel Monroe's latest for the _New Yorker_](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/07/01/how-a-homegrown-teen-gang-punctured-the-image-of-an-upscale-community) reports from the East Valley suburbs of Phoenix, an area I'm intimately familiar with. My family moved to the region (from a rural community in upstate New York) when I was a teenager, and my mom still lives in Chandler.

Monroe's story is about the community after the fatal beating of Preston Lord, a sixteen year old, at the hands of a (mostly white, upper middle class) youth gang calling itself the "Gilbert Goons". Gilbert itself is a municipality of about 300,000 whose [population has grown steadily since the 1990s](https://alex.gilbertaz.gov/stories/population/), yet still insists on calling itself a "town". And about 80,000 residents of this town are under the age of 18. Gilbert recently surpassed nearby [Scottsdale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scottsdale%2C_Arizona) with the highest median income for the entire state.

The local police force and the education system are both implicated in the story. I only spent one year, 2003-04, in the school system, while my younger sister completed 8th grade through high school in the East Valley.

I'm sorry for the longish excerpt below, but this totally tracks with my family's experience with the education system in Arizona:

> Arizona’s strong libertarian tradition has led the state to embrace a consumer-oriented approach to its educational system. “I don’t think people understand what it’s like here,” one parent told me. Since the mid-nineties, Arizona has had open enrollment, meaning that students can attend any public school within a given district. “There are eleven different schools with over two thousand kids, some with three thousand kids, all within seven miles of me,” the parent went on. “The troublemakers can switch schools really easily. Or kids switch schools because of bullying, or because they just don’t like the kids there.”
> 
> Several parents told me that open enrollment contributes to a sense of unrootedness in the East Valley. That feeling was compounded when, in 2022, Arizona became the first state to implement a universal school-voucher program. Students can now have their pick of strip-mall schools, online religious homeschooling programs, or “traditional academies”—charter schools that emphasize discipline and often boast Roman columns out front. The voucher program was designed to help poor children leave failing schools, but a large majority of the money has gone to wealthy families whose children were already enrolled in private education. (The program has also led to a funding crisis for the state, which currently faces a budget shortfall of more than eight hundred million dollars.) “It’s really eroded the sense of community and destabilized what was already a pretty destabilized system,” Beth Lewis, the director of Save Our Schools Arizona, a public-schools advocacy group, said. “Parents will get frustrated with something going on, rightly or wrongly, and they just say, ‘Forget it, I’m going down the street.’ ”

Pretty wild to read about a place you're intimately familiar with in a national media outlet. [The whole feature is worth reading](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/07/01/how-a-homegrown-teen-gang-punctured-the-image-of-an-upscale-community), with an incredible hyperreal illustration by [Max Guther](https://www.maxguther.de/index.html).
