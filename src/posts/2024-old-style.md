![Day 15: Old style serifs](/img/post-images/26Days-O-15-Oldstyle-1024x576.png)

Not talking about a [beer label](https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/447/1727/) today, but a type classification for fonts like Garamond.

With [26 Days of Type](/26-days-of-type.html) I spent a lot of time talking about grotesques and slab serifs so far, and wanted to make sure I did not overlook the old style serif. Old style serif typefaces are based on designs popular between the 15th and 18th centuries for book printing. Some of these designs include:

- [Bembo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bembo), a typeface based on 15th century Italian Renaissance printing.

- [Garamond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garamond), any number of typefaces inspired by or ascribed to French designer and punchcuttter [Claude Garamond](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Garamond).

- [Janson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janson), typefaces from the Dutch Baroque period.

- [Palatino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatino), a 1949 release designed by Hermann Zapf, based on Renaissance Humanist type.

- [Sabon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabon), a Garamond revival released in 1967, designed by Jan Tschichold.

Old styles can be characterized by a number of features. They tend to have lower contrast between thick and thin strokes, and usually have a shorter [x-height](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-height) than Transitional or Modern serif fonts. Sometimes the crossbar of the lowercase **e** is diagonal, as with [Adobe Jenson](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/adobe-jenson). The axis of the round characters like **o** leans more sharply toward the left in old style serifs, as opposed to the vertical upright axis of a Modern type like Bodoni. (Transitional typefaces, like Georgia and Times New Roman are somewhere in between.)

Old style serifs are based on humanist forms, which are especially noticeable in the italic styles.

With the term _old style_, I should also mention numbers. Oldstyle figures are one of two styles of numerals, also called _non-lining_ or _hanging_ figures. These numbers have varying heights and alignments, and are similar to lowercase characters, in that they have an [x-height](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-height) and ascenders and descenders. It's much more common to see lining figures today, which are of uniform height and sit on a baseline. Many contemporary old style typefaces feature both kinds of numbers today.
