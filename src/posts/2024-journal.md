![Day 10: Journal](/img/post-images/26Days-J-Journal-1024x576.png)

When I started planning out [26 Days of Type](/26-days-of-type.html), I had a sense I would be writing about my design school education, when I _really_ started taking notice of visual culture, or was at least developing the vocabulary for it. And this would mean I'd be risking nostalgia.

Realizing this risk, I knew I wanted to wrote about [Emigre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emigre_Fonts) and [Zuzana Licko](https://fonts.adobe.com/designers/zuzana-licko). Emigre, Inc. is the type foundry run by Licko and her husband Rudy VanderLans in Berkeley, California. Licko designed most of the fonts for _Emigre_, the magazine VanderLans edited and art directed. The mid-1980s to early '90s a time where desktop publishing was on the rise, but few people were designing and making digital fonts for personal computers. Licko was pushing the limits of the digital type production tools available and created unique faces like [Matrix](https://www.emigre.com/Fonts/Matrix-II), [Triplex](https://www.emigre.com/Fonts/Triplex), and [Citizen](https://www.emigre.com/Fonts/Citizen).

While I was a design student in the mid 2000s, _Emigre_ the magazine was publishing its final issues. In their late 1980s and early '90s heyday, they were printing punk stuff like this, which was the kind of thing I gravitated toward:

This kind of design is so hard to do well, and it was already out of fashion by the time I came along. [Image from the Letterform Archive](https://oa.letterformarchive.org/item?workID=lfa_emigre_0019&targPic=lfa_emigre_0019_004.jpg).

Picking just one of Licko's typefaces proved tricky in my alphabetical framework. I decided to pick [Journal](https://www.emigre.com/Fonts/Journal) for a challenge, since it's not super-popular ([Filosofia](https://www.emigre.com/Fonts/Filosofia) and [Mrs. Eaves](https://www.emigre.com/Fonts/Mrs-Eaves) are much more widely used) and I couldn't find much information on it. There's not a full specimen book available to download, either.

Here's what Emigre, Inc. has to say about the creation of Journal:

> Licko wanted to try her hand at an old style stress design, but found the curves difficult to draw with the relatively primitive font tools of the day. The geometric arc curves employed in Triplex, Matrix, and other designs that she had designed previously were easier to create with these early tools because arc curves are more predictable from a construction standpoint and therefore easier to envision. In fact, it was not so much the drawing tools that were the problem, but the preview display. The screen display was not very faithful to the mathematical digital drawing, nor the laser printout, due to the primitive screen rasterizer, and the coarse resolution screen on the monitor. Remember, this was before anti-aliased screens and stochastic ink jet printing came to personal computing.
> 
> Taking a magnifying glass to the 300 dpi printouts, Licko studied how the curves were represented by a series of stair stepped lines on the black and white (non-aliased) grid of the laser printed page. This inspired the designer to construct her new typeface with straight line segments instead of curves; approximating each curve by a series of tangent polylines. This not only solved the screen display preview problem, but gave Journal a rustic look, which nicely complimented the old style stress. The subtle crudeness is reminiscent of the irregularities that appear in letterpress printed specimens, and evokes informal qualities, making Journal suitable for correspondence.

There's something beautiful about a new thing born out of the technological limitations of its time. I'm particularly drawn to the jagged and spiky quality of the letters at medium to large sizes, and how the bold weight almost takes on it's own personality. Although Journal was designed for the magazine, I was flipping through Emigre's early 1990s issues on the Letterform Archive, and didn't come across examples of it being used for text. Maybe I wasn't looking hard enough.

There are quite a few other typefaces with _Journal_ in the name, by the way:

- [Journal](https://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/41702/journal-paratype)
- [Journal Sans](https://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/5533/journal-sans)
- [Foundry Journal](https://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/42126/foundry-journal)
- [Ivy Journal](https://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/74371/ivyjournal)
- [Le Monde Journal](https://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/5637/le-monde-journal)
- [Journal Republica](https://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/175974/journal-republica)
- [Journal Hand](https://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/21819/journal-hand)

## Notable Emigre fonts

- [Alda](https://www.emigre.com/Fonts/Alda) is a text face I quite like. It was designed by Berton Hasebe in 2008, and doesn't really look like anything else out there.
- [Brothers](https://www.emigre.com/Fonts/Brothers) is kind of a 19th century revival display typeface designed by Jonathan Downer. This was everywhere in branding the late 2000s - 2010s
- [Cardea](https://www.emigre.com/Fonts/Cardea) is a beautiful text face by David Cabianca, released in 2004.
- [Cholla and Cholla Slab](https://www.emigre.com/Fonts/Cholla) is kind of a weird-looking family I'd love to see used more. This one was developed by Sibylle Hagmann and came out in 1999.
- [Dead History](https://www.emigre.com/Fonts/Dead-History) and [Keedy Sans](https://www.emigre.com/Fonts/Keedy) both play with contrasting shapes, angles, and roundness. These two scream "1990s design" to me.
- [Fairplex](https://www.emigre.com/Fonts/Fairplex) is another great design by Licko. This is a wonderfully executed example of a low-contrast serif.
- The [Lo-Res family](https://www.emigre.com/Fonts/Lo-Res) are updated versions of Licko's early bitmap fonts, the ones that appear in the early issues of _Emigre_ magazine.
- [Template Gothic](https://www.emigre.com/Fonts/Template-Gothic) by Barry Deck is another one that screams 1990s design. It was used in the logo for the [first season of _Survivor_](https://survivor.fandom.com/wiki/Survivor:_Borneo?file=BorneoLogo2ORI.png#cite_note-5), before they switched to the _Survivor_ logo we know and love today.
- [Vendetta](https://www.emigre.com/Fonts/Vendetta), another John Downer face, from 1999. This one's a revival of old style Venetian type.

All of these (and more) are [available in the Adobe Fonts library](https://fonts.adobe.com/foundries/emigre), by the way.

Emigre's history is full of rich, expressive visual material. To spend more time with the output of Licko, VanderLans and the crew visit the following links:

- The Letterform Archive has the [full print run of _Emigre_ magazine](https://oa.letterformarchive.org/?dims=Collection&vals0=Emigre%20Collection&_ga=2.17628729.1884723703.1677710247-1453205240.1677710247&sortby=collection) digitized, which you can access online.
- Emigre's [vibrant type specimens are all available in PDF form](https://www.emigre.com/TypeSpecimens) on emigre.com, and you can sign up to get the new ones in the mail! Like I said, I'm a fan: [I've been getting these mailed to me](/notes/2022-05-10-emigre-specimens.html) since 2007 or so.
- As always, [Fonts in Use comes through](https://fontsinuse.com/foundry/28/emigre) with a showcase of design from the 1990s and 2000s using Emigre fonts.
- There's plenty of [essays and stuff from Emigre's history](https://www.emigre.com/Essays) to read on their website that may be relevant if you are interested in type or graphic design.
