I recently got a rubber stamp made with my N.S. "spark" logo. This is an ["inspector stamp" from Cranky Press](https://www.crankypress.com/products/custom-inspector-stamp/) (based in Salem, Ohio). The inside of the black cap is an ink pad with bright red ink. The metal part is outfitted with a key ring, which is nifty too.

Until now, this logo mainly existed in digital form. I applied it to my FreshBooks invoicing template, and I think that's the only time I've ever seen it printed.

Now every piece of paper I stamp can become "official" correspondence. I might use it on the inside cover of books I own, too.

I'm not sure everyone needs a personal monogram, or logo. But everyone should have a custom rubber stamp. This thing is so damn satisfying.

As you can tell in this photo, it is going to take me some practice aligning the thing upright—although my logo does work upside-down. Perfectly imperfect in every way.
