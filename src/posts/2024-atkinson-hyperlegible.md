I am trying out something new for the month of February. Each day I'm going to explore a different typeface or topic related to typography. I'm calling it [26 Days of Type](https://nicksimson.com/tags/26daysoftype/).

The first featured font is Atkinson Hyperlegible. This is a sans serif typeface created in partnership with the [Braille Institute](https://brailleinstitute.org/), designed "specifically to increase legibility for readers with low vision, and to improve reading comprehension." It is also the web font I chose for most of the type on this very website.

The first line in my specimen ("Handgloves" above) shows the open spaces in the lowercase **a** and **e**. Other than that, it looks quite similar to many contemporary sans serif designs. What sets Atkinson Hyperlegible apart from many other "grotesque" or sans serif designs is the way each character has been [optimized for maximum legibility](https://material.io/blog/atkinson-hyperlegible-design).

Similar characters like the uppercase **O** and numeral **0** are drawn with different proportions and features. That numeral **0** is always reminiscent of monospaced or coding fonts to me. The uppercase **I** and lowercase **i** both feature serifs to distinguish them from numeral **1** and lowercase **l**. Even the descender of the **j** is exaggerated slightly so there is no confusing these letters. I also love the little hook coming off the right of the lowercase **q**, something you are more likely to see in handwriting.

I don't think Atkinson is exaggerated to the point of disrupting the reading experience, but I'm particularly sensitive to the italics. Atkinson's italics are slanted at a sharper angle, compared to other fonts like Inter and Source Sans. To maintain character recognition, the italic **_a_** is also a "two-story a", distinguishing it from an italic **_o_**. My typeface design preference is usually for a "true" italic, rather than simply slanted characters. I do like the italics in Inter, maybe even more than the regular "upright" version of the typeface. Check out the **_f_** and **_e_** on the middle line in the specimen above.

## When to use Atkinson

- You want something to be very readable.
- You are targeting low-vision users.
- Your design uses a fair amount of small print.
- You want a user interface that feels less default, more quirky than something like [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/).
