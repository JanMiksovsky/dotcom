In letterpress printing, moveable type made from wood originated in China in the 9th century, along with clay moveable type. In the early nineteenth century, mass production made wood a popular material for type because of its lightness and cost, especially for large letters for broadside printing[1](#ea042760-4e56-4b2c-936f-989b76f6ecae).

Commercial printing and the need for new typefaces exploded in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and these antique typefaces have such a range of eclectic and expressive features. Old type that has been inked and pressed, handled and dropped for decades or centuries takes on a distressed or worn look. It might be rarer to see four decades in to this digital visual landscape, but wood type is still being manufactured, used for posters and printing, and the wood type look is still popular today.

The [Hamilton Wood Type and Printing Museum](https://woodtype.org/pages/about) in Two Rivers, Wisconsin is home to the largest collection of wood type in North America. The University of Texas at Austin houses the [Rob Roy Kelly Collection](https://rrk.finearts.utexas.edu/?page_id=176), of over 150 wood typefaces and ornaments. David Shields published a [history of the RRK collection](https://utpress.utexas.edu/9781477323687/) in 2022 and maintains a [research blog for all things 19th and 20th century wood type related](https://www.woodtyperesearch.com/). The [Web Museum of Wood Types and Ornaments](https://www.unicorngraphics.com/wood%20type%20museum.asp) is another great resource for browsing digitized specimens of this stuff.

If you're looking to replicate the wood type look digitally, Adobe Fonts features the [Hamilton Wood Type Collection](https://fonts.adobe.com/foundries/hamilton-wood-type-foundry). This set of fonts is based on 19th century typefaces made by Hamilton Manufacturing and digitized by [P22 Foundry](https://p22.com/). Jonathan Hoefler has used wood types of the 19th century as inspiration for digital fonts beginning with [Champion Gothic](https://www.typography.com/fonts/champion-gothic/) released in 1991, the [Knockout](https://www.typography.com/fonts/knockout/) family in 1994, and [Ringside](https://www.typography.com/fonts/ringside/), a family for text sizes.
