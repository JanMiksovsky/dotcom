It's December again. Winter will be here soon in the Northern Hemisphere. I can see snow on the Sandia Mountains outside my office window.

December is always my most anxious month. Something about the calendar winding out and a new year coming in does something to my psyche. The web advent calendars are always cool, but I end up waiting until January or February to consume that content. I’m on a project at work with a January deadline, and things definitely don't feel like they are slowing down this month.

I've been going to the doctor's office every couple weeks about my blood pressure and am currently on some medication to bring it down. I've also gotten more serious about exercise and trying to shed some pounds. I typically don't make New Year's resolutions, but here we are.

Despite everything going on, I do feel prepared for the holidays here. Most of my gifts are ready to be wrapped, and the halls are decked. The calendar is filling up with gatherings, and I find myself texting people I haven't connected with in a long time.

Christmastime in New Mexico can be quite magical. It’s the season of [biscochitos](https://somethewiser.com/2014/12/biscochitos-traditional-new-mexican-cookies.html), [luminarias/farolitos](https://www.newmexico.org/holidays/luminaria-vs-farolito/), and [Las Posadas](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Las-Posadas). If you were to step out on a cold winter day in Santa Fe Plaza or Old Town Albuquerque, you're likely to smell the distinct smell of piñon wood smoke. After so many memorable past Christmases in the Southwest, I'm delighted to celebrate my first as a proper New Mexico resident.

Looking back, my favorite memories of past holiday seasons always involve family members: my grandmother wadding up a ball of gift wrap and making an effortless 3-pointer from across the living room into the waste basket. My mom re-arranging the cookies on a plate to make it look full again. Opening gag gifts from my father, or reminiscing about gag gifts received in years gone by.

My one-year-old can now recognize Santa Claus in books and other media. Not sure if she has put all the pieces of the holiday puzzle together, but she's clearly paying attention. I'm excited to experience this season through her young eyes, pass down some family traditions and maybe start some new ones.
