![Day 5: Epilogue](/img/post-images/26Days-E-Epilogue-1024x576.png)

Welcome to the fifth consecutive post in my [26 Days of Type](/26-days-of-type.html) series. My goal for this series is to highlight typography in an accessible way, and part of that is including several free and open-source fonts.

[Epilogue](https://etceteratype.co/epilogue) falls into that free and open-source category, and I'm highlighting it for a few reasons. It's a pretty high-quality and versatile font. Epilogue features alternate characters, small caps, both proportional and tabular numerals, fractions, arrows, and a wide range of currency, punctuation, and other symbols.

Epilogue comes with alternates for six characters, among other features

It's also a unique design. To my eye, it has elements of both geometric and traditional grotesque sans serifs. But two characters that immediately stick out are the default lowercase **g** with the open _loop_ and upward-facing _ear_, and the slightly rounded upper left corner in the lowercase **t**. It's all about the details! I also find that the capital letters have an almost semi-condensed appearance compared to the lowercase, especially characters like D, E, F, L, and T. The contrast is not quite as dramatic as a typeface like [Stratos by Production Type](https://www.productiontype.com/family/stratos), though.

Here's the type designer, [Ty Finck](https://tyfromtheinternet.com/), explaining Epilogue in his own words:

> Sometimes you need a clean and crisp go-to font that isn't preinstalled on every computer in the world. Epilogue was made for that. It is familiar but unique enough to be memorable. This makes it both easy to use and a joy to apply. The range of weights (Thin/100 to Black/900) make it easy to accommodate any size requirement, on screen and in print. And with the variable option you can choose your own weight, like 314 or 567. If the thin is feeling too thin try 150, it's all good.

I used Epilogue for the headings on a previous incarnation of my website (2020-2023), and I would totally look for a reason to use this again on another project. The quality and level of detail put into this design make it a great choice for an open-source project or anything on a budget. The variable fonts are a great option for performance considerations, too.
