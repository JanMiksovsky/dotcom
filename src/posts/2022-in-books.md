In 2022, the books I was able to finish tended to be on the shorter side, compared to previous years. You’ll find several books on this list hovering around or under 200 pages. 

I don’t feel like I had a shorter attention span, so much as I had <strong>a lot</strong> competing for my attention in 2022: Mourning the death of a parent; welcoming the arrival of my first child; transitioning back to an in-person office environment during a global pandemic; changing jobs and working from home for a new organization. I still read for pleasure, but I had other priorities to attend to.

That said, there were plenty more books I did finish that did not make this list. Those tend to be of the board book and picture book variety. I left off the reading aloud to my little one since it marks a drastic deviation from my previous years’ lists. I also lost track of the titles and number of times I read each one. 

That does not diminish the importance of this kind of reading. My favorite of the board books was <i>Little Owl’s Night</i>, by Divya Srinivasan. I think my daughter’s favorite was probably <i>What’s for Breakfast?</i> by Steph Stilwell.
