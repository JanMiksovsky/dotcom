Isn't all typeface design geometric? Letters are usually a mixture of straight lines and curves and angles. The genre or classification we call **geometric sans-serifs** are called that because the forms so closely resemble pure geometric shapes: circles and rectangles and sometimes triangles. Geometric typefaces are a century-old innovation, coming out of the [Bauhaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauhaus) movement in the 1920s.

Geometric typefaces were popular and deployed in Modernist graphic design throughout the mid-20th century. Today this classification or genre is still quite popular, especially in branding or logotypes. Notably, [Google switched its logo](https://www.dezeen.com/2015/09/01/google-rebrands-new-sans-serif-logo-alphabet/) to a geometric sans-serif design in 2015 (around the same time its parent company renamed to Alphabet). Some of the brand attributes a geometric typeface might communicate are _simplicity_, _friendly_, _modernist_, _sophistication_, _streamlined_.

## So many shapes

Geometric typeface designs are deceptively simple. I find that this one genre can encompass a wide gamut of character shapes and expression. Compare the letters **t**, **a**, **g** in Outfit and DM Sans (below). Also notice the angles where the strokes end in the uppercase **S** and lowercase **e**.

<figure>

[Outfit](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit) features a "crucifix" **t** and single-story **a** and **g** characters. [DM Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Sans) has a more traditional **t**, and two-story characters.

Geometric fonts are where you're more likely to encounter sharp corners in characters like **A**,**M**,**N**,**V**,**v**,**W**,**w**. But not always:

![pointy N and v characters in Neutra Text compared to Satoshi which is more squared off.](/img/post-images/26Days-G-Geometric-Nova-1024x576.png)

The dots in the **i**, **j** characters and punctuation like the **?** can also be a variety of shapes—circles, squares, diamonds!—and can dramatically change the overall feeling of the typeface's design.

## When should I use a geometric as opposed to a more traditional sans-serif?

Geometric fonts always look good big and bold, so use these for headlines! If you are using all caps Futura or [Gotham](https://www.typography.com/fonts/gotham/overview) for example, consider adding some additional letterspacing between the characters. [Google Fonts' knowledge base](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/geometric) comes with this warning:

> The repeating, similar shapes within these typefaces can hinder readability, making them less ideal for body text.

I would heed this advice, but take it with a grain of salt. I think certain typefaces like [DM Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Sans), [Soleil](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/soleil), and [Avenir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avenir_(typeface)) are fine for long-running body text, where things like Futura and [Neutraface](https://housefonts.com/hi/neutraface) would be better for headlines, blockquotes, and shorter runs of text. Pay attention to numerals, and consider things like if you need [proportional or tabular figures](https://www.fonts.com/content/learning/fontology/level-3/numbers/proportional-vs-tabular-figures). Look for key characters (a single story **a** might get mixed up with an **o** at small sizes) and features (sharp, pointy characters should probably be avoided in body text) to make this determination, and test, test, test!

## Slab-serifs with a geometric appearance

As a Real Slab Head™, I can't press "publish" on this post without mentioning the serifed cousin to the geometric sans. Here are a few good ones in this criminally underused genre:

- [Rockwell](https://www.fonts.com/font/monotype/rockwell-nova) by Monotype.
- [Memphis](https://www.fonts.com/font/linotype/memphis) by Rudolf Wolf.
- [Serifa](https://www.fonts.com/font/linotype/serifa) by Adrian Frutiger is actually more related to Univers that Avenir, but those slabs make it feel on the cusp of something more geometric.
- [Neutraface Slab](https://housefonts.com/hi/neutraface_slab) by House Industries.
- [Archer](https://www.typography.com/fonts/archer/overview) by Hoefler & Co.
