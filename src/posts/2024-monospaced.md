![Day 13: Monospaced](/img/post-images/26Days-M-Monospaced-1-1024x576.png)

We're halfway through the alphabet today, and up until now I've barely mentioned the _monospaced_ classification. These fonts are derived from typewriters and early computing, but are still very useful today.

A monospaced typeface differs from a _proportional_ typeface in that each character space is the same width. It doesn't necessarily mean that each _glyph_ within each space is exactly the same width, but that characters will align from line to line. Monospaced fonts are optimized for legibility, and are usually marked by features like a compressed **m** (a wider character in proportional faces) and serifs on the **i**, even if the monospaced font is otherwise free of serifs.

DejaVu Sans and DejaVu Sans Mono are part of the [same typeface family](https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/).

Coders/programmers/developers, however they identify, spend a lot of time in their code editors each day building software. I know some folks who are very particular about the color theme, font size, and monospaced font they use. Me? I use [Menlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menlo_(typeface)) (I had to crack open VSCode to double-check) a font which was Apple's default monospace from 2009 – 2015.

Monospaced type is also used to denote `code` samples on the web, like in this CSS example below:

```
body {
  background color: #3b3b3b;
  font-family: ui-monospace, 'Cascadia Code', 'Source Code Pro', Menlo, Consolas, 'DejaVu Sans Mono', monospace;
  font-weight: normal;
  color: #fdfdfd;
}
```

If you are interested in trying out some different monospaced fonts for code, there's an excellent website called [Programming Fonts](https://www.programmingfonts.org/), where you can try out 142 examples, most of them open source. The old CSS-Tricks (RIP) had a [neat microsite (Internet Archive link)](https://web.archive.org/web/20210613024224/https://coding-fonts.css-tricks.com/) that let you see visual examples. It featured a smaller selection, but there were a few more paid fonts in the examples.

## Other uses for a mono

Monospaced fonts don't have to be restricted to coding or code examples, but they do give off a techie or typewritten vibe.

[Space Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Space+Mono/about), developed by [Colophon Foundry](https://www.colophon-foundry.org/) for Google Design, was not envisioned as a programming font, but for "editorial use in headline and display typography."

<figure>
 <blockquote>
  <p>[T]he letterforms infuse a geometric foundation and grotesque details with qualities often found in headline typefaces of the 1960s (See: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microgramma_(typeface)">Microgramma</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurostile">Eurostile</a>), many of which have since been co-opted by science fiction films, television, and literature.</p>

The newer tech journalism upstart [404 Media](https://www.404media.co/) uses [Space Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Space+Mono) (in all caps) in the masthead, navigation, and supporting text throughout their website, paired with Space Grotesk for headlines and Inter for body text. [Oak Studios](https://oak.is/) uses [Input Mono](https://input.djr.com/) for their website body type, with headings in Tiempos Headline.

Typewriter fonts like [Courier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courier_(typeface)) also have their place in digital design. A throwback to the 1950s, Courier New is one of 9 standard "[web safe fonts](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/system_font_web_safe_font)" and is standard in every kind of modern computer and web browser. 12pt. Courier is the industry standard for Hollywood screenplays, and up until 2004, the official font for the U.S. State Department. Be aware that some "typewriter fonts" are not true monospaced designs, such as [American Typewriter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Typewriter), which is a proportionally spaced slab-serif.

The [Good Enough website](https://goodenough.us/) is quite minimal, and uses the [IBM Plex Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Mono) typeface (which has typewriter heritage in its DNA) to straightforward effect. [Murray's Cheese](https://www.murrayscheese.com/) uses [Vulf Mono](https://ohnotype.co/fonts/vulf) as a supporting typeface for the "tasting notes" under each product on their website.
