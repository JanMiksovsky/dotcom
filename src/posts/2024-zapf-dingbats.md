_Really?_ This is how he chose to end it?

You might not think I'm serious, but I really did want to close my alphabetical series on type with [Hermann Zapf](https://www.dezeen.com/2015/06/17/beyond-dingbats-typographic-legacy-of-hermann-zapf/) and his eponymous dingbat font.

A dingbat, of course, is a typographic glyph that is not a letter, number, or form of punctuation[1](#dd2e1735-d051-4fdc-9aa9-becc393d4ed2). They're often pictograms, sometimes ornaments or borders, and can either be extra symbols in a font, or a complete symbol font itself.

Zapf Dingbats itself was drawn by Hermann Zapf in the 1970s and released by the International Typeface Corporation in 1977. 360 symbols were grouped into three sets of 120 glyphs (ITC-100, ITC-200, and ITC-300).

 <blockquote>
  <p>Welcome to the Dingbat Revival! Decades of absence from the printed page was a natural reaction to the tasteless overuse of dingbats that inevitably led to a dearth of dingbat designs. Hermann Zapf now fills that void with a collection of winners grouped by the designer into three dingbat series to be known as ITC-100, ITC-200, and ITC-300. Each dingbat bears a universal number for precise identification on any keyboard or manual typesetting machine as well as on transfer and cutout sheets. A sensitive look at typography reveals that restrained, tasteful use of ornament is the lyric side of the printed page—a fresh delight to the eye. Welcome back.</p>

The symbols in Zapf Dingbats are recognizable as [Unicode symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dingbats_(Unicode_block)). The dingbats from Zapf's font made their way into the Unicode Standard in 1991. One of my favorites, the V-hand sign (✌) was adopted as the official logo for the entrepreneur/startup website [AngelList](https://www.angellist.com/). The Unicode symbols of course are a precursor to [emoji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji), more widely used in our digital lives today.

In 1992, _Ray Gun_ magazine art director David Carson infamously [typeset an entire interview in Zapf Dingbats](https://processandskillsdotcom.wordpress.com/2013/04/21/david-carson-and-his-notorious-use-of-dingbats/) because he found the content so dull and uninspired.

I find Zapf a fascinating figure. Born in 1918, he witnessed all the changes of type, printing, and communication technologies, from the hot metal days to the desktop publishing, to the smartphone age and the rise of emoji, up until his death in 2015.

## A dingbat sampler

The kinds of dingbats you'll usually find in a standard text typeface include directional arrows, [fleurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleuron_(typography)) (glyphs derived from flowers, ivy leaves, and other horticultural inspiration), and manicules (hands pointing, clenching fists, making other gestures, or doing things).

I really like manicules, and I'm always looking for new examples in the fonts I choose. My current favorite manicule sets are in the fonts [Scala](https://www.martinmajoor.com/1_scala.html) by Martin Majoor, [SwingKing](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/swing-king-icons) by the Ivy Foundry, and [Covik Sans](https://ohnotype.co/fonts/covik) (four fingers!) by Oh No Type Co. I included examples from each (plus Covik's snowflakes, sparkles, and poop) in the image below:

[The Ivy Foundry](https://ivyfoundry.com/) is named after the fleuron symbol, and each of its typefaces feature this glyph, styled to match the letters and punctuation its bundled with. The typeface [Soleil](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/soleil) by TypeTogether appropriately features different sunbursts.

![A hedgehog, some sunbursts, and a whole lot of ivy](/img/post-images/26Days-Z-Dingbats-various-1024x576.png)

My current favorite dingbat of all time is the hedgehog in Work Sans (above). I only learned about it from visiting the [GitHub page](https://github.com/weiweihuanghuang/Work-Sans) recently, and unraveling the mystery behind it is my current obsession. _Why a hedgehog? Why are there few other dingbats in Work Sans?_ I need to find out more.

Stay tuned. For the rest of February, I have a few bonus posts up my sleeve.
