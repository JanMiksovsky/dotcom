In 2024 I developed a writing habit. I made this goal as easy as possible: write for a few minutes a day during the work week, and a little more time on the weekends. There’s some days I certainly missed, but I mostly stuck with the habit. I found it rewarding, and really good for maintaining my focus and attention.

I found writing daily to be a very inward-focused habit. I found myself reflecting on things that happened during the day, or in my past, and often a response to something I read or listened to. Some of these thoughts found their way to my website, either as short notes or longer posts. I will continue writing in 2025.

In 2025, I want to continue to work on managing my focus and attention. But this year I’d like to develop habits that are a bit more externally focused. Ways of being a more intentional worker, consumer, and citizen. I came up with a list of instructions to myself for the next twelve months.

What follows are 25 intentions for 2025:

1. Follow through on your commitments. Politely decline the things you know will burn you out.

2. Go to the mat for the things that really matter.

3. Stay in touch. Let your people know how much they matter.

4. Listen to your kid.

5. Get to know your neighbors. Learn the history of your community, too.

6. Get to know the people that represent you in government. Even the ghoulish ones.

7. Keep walking the dog.

8. Spend less time scrolling the timeline.

9. Spend a little more time with RSS.

10. Spend a lot more time with a book.

11. Delete that time-suck app from your phone (you know the one).

12. Buy music on [Bandcamp Fridays](https://isitbandcampfriday.com/). Explore the artists using [Faircamp](https://simonrepp.com/faircamp/) and [Bandwagon](https://bandwagon.fm/) too.

13. Support more union drives and worker-owned media.

14. Make “artist” a viable middle class occupation.

15. Pay for the things you use or want to exist.

16. Maybe don’t rush to sign up for the next Venture Capital backed thing.

17. Introduce a little more friction in your life. Not everything should be on-demand.

18. Build things for the web with web standards.

19. Build that website you’ve always dreamed about.

20. Help more people out with the above.

21. Show up for people.

22. Do something outside your comfort zone.

23. Make time to [do nothing at all](https://bookshop.org/a/21729/9781612198552). Let boredom fuel your creativity.

24. Carry a book with you.

25. Try not to be sanctimonious about any of this shit.
