[Maria Bamford](https://www.mariabamford.com/) has over 40 years of experience arranging chairs into circles in libraries and church basements. Thankfully she breaks the sacred rule of anonymity to share her experience with all the various 12 step programs she’s tried.

_[Sure I’ll Join Your Cult](https://bookshop.org/a/21729/9781982168568)_ is a disarmingly honest memoir of Bamford’s life with “the mentals,” starting at a young age with an eating disorder and intrusive thoughts, through treatment and multiple hospitalizations, finding professional success, and the life she lives today. Besides the 12 step programs, there are other “cults” the author encountered: The cult of family; the cult of fame; Suzuki violin. Bamford tells her own story refreshingly free of clichés, and yes, this book is actually funny.

My introduction to the author was her hourlong homemade Christmas special, posted online, which you can still find on YouTube and other video hosting sites today. As a casual comedy fan, her performance on her sofa with two snoring pugs was something revelatory, and I immediately tried to get all my friends and loved ones sit down and watch this with me. Reactions to the special were pretty divided. My friends and family either loved her, or were disturbed by her.

Bamford has made a successful career of being niche: her work is not for everyone, and she’s not after the world’s broadest audience, sometimes performing at an outdoor restaurant table for one other adult plus a confused five year old. I can’t write about Maria Bamford without mentioning her hilarious voice talents, and those shine in the audiobook performance. Fans of the comedy will find some insights into her relationships with her family members who she impersonates and exaggerates in her standup work. She also comes across as quite sincere and appreciative toward the people who have helped her in her mental health treatment, professional work in the entertainment industry, and in publishing this book.

I have my own experience with depression and anxiety, plus the therapy and medication to manage these things. I recognized many of the same cracks in the system of mental health care in the U.S. (even with OK insurance and supportive people around me). As a member of the club, it is good to find a book affirming what can be awkwardly funny about these things, too.
