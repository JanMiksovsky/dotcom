Every web account requires you to register some kind of username, and I've been using "nsmsn" everywhere for more than a decade now. I registered the domain name [nsmsn.co](https://nsmsn.co/) and have it currently pointed at my omg.lol profile, since that destination kind of collects almost all of my various accounts with the same handle.

I don't think I've ever documented the "why" behind my dumb 5 character username, so here we go:

**It is short.** Twitter used to be constrained by a 140 character limit, which included the @ symbol for mentions, anyone's username, plus link addresses (hence the creation of short URLs in the pre-to-early 2010s). By the time I signed up for Twitter, I'm pretty sure my initials (NES) were taken, so I went my **first initial and last name, sans vowels**.

That's it. Boring. My username has nothing to do with [msn.com](https://www.msn.com/) or MSNBC, either.

I've never read [this book](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/60761/faster-by-james-gleick/), but its cover was probably on my mind when I registered my username:

![Faster by James Gleick. The vowels are removed from the title and author on the book cover.](/img/post-images/fstr-book-cover.jpg)

I have kind of a common sounding first and last name, but my last name is often misspelled. I don't even know if my dumb 5 character username helps anyone remember how to spell it correctly, since it itself is kind of forgettable.

Twitter and GitHub users [mrmrs](https://mrmrs.cc/) and [jxnblk](https://jxnblk.com/) have cooler, more memorable names and bigger followings than I will ever enjoy. But when I first encountered their works online, I felt like maybe I was in good company or doing something right with my identity.

[I'm no longer active on Twitter](/posts/2022-ditch-twitter.html) (sorry, _X_) but I kept my username there because for better or worse it is inextricably linked to my identity. I don't want someone to take that handle over and post God knows what with it. I go by that handle on [Mastodon](https://social.lol/@nsmsn) now, and a few other places, too.

I like that **nsmsn** is short. I like that it has a meaning, even if it's just my name but shorter. And I like that it's a palindrome, too. But it's not really pronounceable (I always spell it out N-S-M-S-N, and the Ns often sound like "M") or memorable, either.

Now, more than a decade later, **nsmsn** is something that is usually available on new services, and something I'm probably stuck with as long as either these accounts or I personally continue to exist.
