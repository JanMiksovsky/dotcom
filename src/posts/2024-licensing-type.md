![Day 12: Licensing](images/26Days-L-Licensing-1024x576.png)

What follows isn't legal advice. If you do need legal advice, please find a lawyer. I am not a lawyer, nor do I play one on the internet.

With that out of the way, I am ready to tackle what is probably the most challenging topic in [this series](https://nicksimson.com/26-days-of-type/) so far: Licensing fonts. And this might be my longest post in the series to date, clocking in at nearly 1,600 words. After researching this topic and reading a dozen or so End User Licensing Agreements (EULA), I completely understand why so many organizations large and small default to using Google Fonts.

This is not an exhaustive list of every option out there. Rather, I wanted to highlight a few specific licenses and a few creative models out there for licensing type.

Reading this article is not a substitute for reading the license(s) when you download or buy fonts, or recommend them for a client project. In addition to reading the license, you should also keep a copy of it for every font downloaded to your computer.

## The difference between personal and commercial use

If you haven’t noticed already, most of the fonts I’ve featured in my [26 Days of Type](https://nicksimson.com/26-days-of-type/) series are available in the Google Fonts or Adobe Fonts libraries. These are both popular sources for typography, and the terms and conditions in both services generously cover both personal and commercial use. I wanted to keep this series accessible to a wide audience, and so that is why I spend so much time talking about Google and Adobe Fonts.

Personal use usually means you are using a font to try it and evaluate it on your own, or you're working on a student project. Commercial use could mean using a font to create a logo for a client, or designing a T-shirt to be sold on an online marketplace, or developing a website for a fundraising purpose. Oliver at Pimp My Type has written a [great explainer on personal vs. commercial use](https://pimpmytype.com/personal-vs-commercial-use/):

> Personal is basically anything that is not intended to make any money in a **direct** or an **indirect** way. If it’s not personal, it’s commercial.
> 
> Oliver Schöndorfer

Years ago, I heard the story of an intern who cost their agency thousands of dollars by using a trial or personal use font in a client project that went to production. I understand that is not a life or death scenario; just an example that there are risks to ignoring the different kinds of licenses out there on the web.

## Open source font licenses

The majority of open source fonts including those on [Google](https://fonts.google.com) and [Bunny.net](https://fonts.bunny.net/) use the [SIL Open Font License](https://openfontlicense.org/) (OFL). This license allows you to do make just about anything with the fonts and use them anywhere, including modifying a font and redistributing it. The main thing you can't do is sell any OFL-licensed fonts or OFL-derived fonts.

Another great place to find good SIL OFL fonts is [Open Foundry](https://open-foundry.com/fonts), including some that aren't on Google. [Free Faces](https://www.freefaces.gallery/) is a curated gallery of typefaces available under a variety of free licenses. Besides the OFL, other popular open source licenses for fonts include the [Apache license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) and the [Ubuntu Font License](https://ubuntu.com/legal/font-licence).

## Fontshare: a mixture of open and closed source designs

[Fontshare](https://www.fontshare.com) by Indian Type Foundry (ITF) is another great place on the web to find quality type free for personal and commercial use. What's important to know here are that there are two kinds of licenses: OFL which I explained above, and [ITF's Free Font License](https://www.fontshare.com/licenses/itf-ffl) (FFL), which **doesn't allow you re-sell or to redistribute** derivative fonts based on ITF designs.

## Adobe Fonts: generous, but restrictive in one important way

If you are a Creative Cloud subscriber, you have access to thousands of fonts through Adobe Fonts, which can be used for both personal and commercial use. The [Adobe Fonts license FAQ page](https://helpx.adobe.com/fonts/using/font-licensing.html) covers many scenarios you might use these fonts in. **Commercial use includes embedding Adobe Fonts on your own personal or company website.**

It's a generous license, but here's the caveat: **If you are creating something for a client** to modify and use on their own (an InDesign template for a menu for example), they must have their own Creative Cloud subscription. Similarly, you can't host the webfonts for a client's website in your own Adobe account: Your client will need their own Creative Cloud subscription.

> The [Terms of Use](https://www.adobe.com/go/adobe-fonts-terms) do not permit reselling beyond December 31, 2019. After that time, the client's website must load Adobe Fonts from their own Creative Cloud subscription to ensure that there isn't any interruption to the font licensing or web font hosting.

> Please refer to the full [Terms of Use](https://www.adobe.com/go/adobe-fonts-terms) for more information on what reselling the service means, and related definitions.

Oliver from Pimp My Type again has a helpful article for freelancers on this topic, last updated in 2021: [With Adobe Fonts it gets harder to use web fonts for client websites](https://pimpmytype.com/adobe-fonts-web-fonts/). Depending on the fonts, the [type foundry](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/type_foundry), and the project, it may end up being worthwhile to buy and license the web fonts directly from the type foundry, and self-host. Oliver also links to an article by Donny Trương about [moving off from Adobe Fonts for his book projects](https://visualgui.com/2019/02/19/moving-off-adobe-fonts/).

The typeface selection on Adobe Fonts is wonderful, but as a platform for type, it feels a bit like Spotify does for music. Your subscription gives you access to this great stuff, but you don't really own anything. If you're investing in typography for your brand, perhaps you want to have a more stable license to these things. I've seen fonts come and go and pop back on the platform. I'm also left wondering _how much money are the smaller foundries and designers making off this relationship?_

## "Pay-what-you-want" foundries

[Lost Type Co-Op](https://www.losttype.com/about/), started in 2011, was one of the first type foundries on the web to offer a pay-what-you-want [license for personal use](https://www.losttype.com/images/samples/License_Personal_Sample.pdf). [Commercial license](https://www.losttype.com/images/samples/License_Commercial_Sample.pdf) prices vary depending on the typeface or type family, and the number of computers it will be installed on.

[Atipo](https://www.atipofoundry.com/) is another foundry offering a [pay-what-you-want license](https://www.atipofoundry.com/license) (they have recommended starting prices for fonts and font packages). What's nice about their webfont offering is that is covers a single website, but unlimited pageviews.

[Alanna Munro](https://alannamunro.com) also sells fonts with a pay-what-you-can model for personal use. [Her licensing page](https://alannamunro.com/licensing/) is very detailed, but easy to read.

## Simple, straightforward licenses and pricing

[Dan Cederholm designs charming display fonts](https://simplebits.shop/collections/fonts) and distributes them from his SimpleBits studio under a ["super simple license" agreement](https://simplebits.shop/pages/licenses): one license = 1 desktop user **or** one domain name. Add more licenses for each use.

[Ty Finck](https://tyfromtheinternet.com/) also sells his typefaces online. His fonts are a great deal: for one price, you get both desktop and webfonts. There's one price for commercial and personal use, no renewals, and (I'm pretty sure) you can use the webfonts on more than one website. He has a helpful [TL;DR on his licensing page](https://tyfromtheinternet.com/eula/) (though like I said, you should read the full license).

[Lettermatic](https://lettermatic.com/) is a newer foundry that makes some great-looking typefaces. They have a [pretty simple licensing model](https://lettermatic.com/license), with pricing for three tiers of end users: Students, Freelancers, and Companies. There are no renewals either: "Your license is perpetual as long as your company size, or status as a Student or Freelancer remains accurate."

## More standard EULAs

By now you might have noticed a pattern. Outside of the open source licenses and subscription models, every type foundry pretty much has their own license and End User Licensing Agreements (EULA).

[Okay Type](https://okaytype.com/) uses what they call a "[modular EULA](https://okaytype.com/info/eula)", where the terms for using their fonts are in different addendums for Desktop, Website, and Apps. Desktop pricing is based on the number of users. Website pricing is based on the number of pageviews. Okay Type also has a [helpful FAQ page](https://okaytype.com/info/faq).

[Sharp Type's licensing page](https://sharptype.co/licensing/), is a starting point for different EULAs for Desktop, Web, and App licenses, as well as contact information for Broadcast and Retail Merchandising. Again, pricing is based on desktop users, website pageviews, and app monthly active users.

One thing I've noticed about most smaller foundries is that they are pretty open to answering questions about their licenses, so if anything is unclear, send them an email!

## Buying from the juggernaut

I'm highlighting [MyFonts.com](https://www.myfonts.com/) only because they are one of the bigger players in retail fonts and owned by [Monotype Imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotype_Imaging), the juggernaut of type companies. With most fonts on MyFonts, there is a separate EULA for each of the following:

- App

- Electronic Doc (including PDFs)

- Digital Ad/Email

- Webfonts ("MyFonts offers three types of webfont licenses: Annual, Pay Once, and Pay As You Go. Only one of these three would be available for a given webfont.")

- Desktop (one user per license)

Monotype also sells a number of [subscription-based type products](https://www.monotypefonts.com/a/content/plans) for creative agencies, freelancers, and large brands.

I feel like I've only scratched the surface in this installment. I thought about including the unique model of [Future Fonts](https://www.futurefonts.xyz/about), but the EULAs vary, since each type designer on that platform is independent. I didn't even get into the font renting model, which you can do with apps like [Fontstand](https://fontstand.com/). I welcome any corrections and suggestions for improving this post, too. Hope this was helpful.
