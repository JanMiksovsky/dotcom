In planning, researching, writing and designing my [26 Days of Type](https://nicksimson.com/26-days-of-type/) series, I wanted to cover a diverse array of typefaces and topics in an accessible way. I'm proud of the work I was able to do on my blog this month, but a personal project from one person's perspective has its limitations.

Retrospectively, I wished I called the series 26 Days of \[Latin\] Type. At one point during my brainstorming and planning, I thought it would be interesting at some point to write about non-Latin alphabets. But I quickly realized I am not the person to write such a blog post. I have no experience speaking or reading Arabic, Greek, Hebrew, Japanese, Korean, or any language that doesn't use the Latin alphabet.

I have no business being _confidently wrong_ about this subject. So instead I want to highlight a few places that One great resources for exploring non-Latin typefaces is [Typographica](https://typographica.org/category/script-or-writing-system/), a site for type reviews, books, and commentary on all things type. From the filters navigation, you can select "Script" and a dropdown of non-Latin script options appears. This is a great resource for finding unique fonts in another writing system or learning about type designers working in other languages.

Another site that features a diverse array of scripts and voices is [Alphabettes](https://www.alphabettes.org/), a site focusing on the work of women and nonbinary people in lettering, typography, and type design. Alphabettes has been going since 2015 and features the work of [over 300 members from all over the world](https://www.alphabettes.org/about/all-alphabettes/).

I came nowhere near representing the diversity of type design with my series, but I was proud to feature several fonts designed by women, as well as two Black American type designers during Black History month.

The feedback I've received on this project has been positive so far. A few people have shared that they learned new things from reading my posts! I learned a lot researching and writing these posts myself. I did not assume any expertise or ignorance from my audience, and I hope I was able to present information in an accessible, albeit idiosyncratic way. That said, I'm sure I have blind spots and got some things wrong along the way. If you have corrections or any other feedback on my writing, please leave a reply here or email me at [nick@nicksimson.com](mailto:nick@nicksimson.com).

**A font is a personal thing.** It is technology we choose to express ourselves with. Every [BÃ©zier curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve) in each digital glyph is loaded with history, intention, and meaning.

I'm hoping to expand upon this writing in an updated version of [Typo.town](https://typo.town/) later this year. Besides working on that, I'm looking forward to blogging here about some other things in March and beyond.
