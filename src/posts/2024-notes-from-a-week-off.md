It's early December and I'm already feeling End-of-the-Year Energyâ„¢. Days are cooler and shorter here in Albuquerque, and still quite dry. I was away the last week at work as well as taking a short break from posting stuff on the web.

## The arid zone

My daughter's preschool was closed for the whole week, so I took the days off before Thanksgiving and we planned a road trip to Arizona, mainly to see my mom, my sister and nephew.

We put up our holiday decorations early, so the house would feel Christmas-y when we got home. My wife and I went to our first parent teacher conference at the new preschool on Monday afternoon. Got a great report, and we're really happy to have our kid enrolled there. This school is nearby and convenient for us as working parents, and they did a wonderful job preparing our oldest niece and nephew for grade school.

For whatever reason I thought Flagstaff would be a six hour drive from Albuquerque, but as it turns out it is closer to five hours from our house. So that was a pleasant way to start our road trip on Tuesday. My wife and I met at Northern Arizona University, where we both studied, and this was our first time back in that city since 2015. This time we stayed with A and his family. It was great to catch up and finally meet each others' kids. Our little one loved A's two hounds most of all. We didn't do much else in Flagstaff, but did drive around NAU Wednesday morning to see how the campus has changed before heading down I-17 to the Phoenix area.

Mom lives in the city of Chandler in a neighborhood built around a golf course, exclusively for residents age 55 and older. She complained about the size of her kitchen a couple times, but overall I think I'm relieved that my parents downsized back in 2016, now that Mom lives alone. Mom has some good friends in her neighborhood plus a lot of social activities on her calendar. Still sad my dad never got to enjoy retirement, but at least my mom seems to be enjoying hers.

We brought orange cranberry rolls and cheesy jalapeno cornbread for Thanksgiving dinner. Mom made a huge pot of chili the day before. I baked a pumpkin cheesecake and prepared another orange-cranberry dish on Wednesday night. My mom and sister did the lion's share of Thanksgiving cooking on Thursday, even though I tried to encourage a simpler meal this year. My sister is a single parent and works night shifts at a hospital, but something something "love languages". One of the new dishes this year was a [sweet potato casserole](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/21261/yummy-sweet-potato-casserole/) that I think we'll be seeing at future holiday dinners. Mom has a small dining area table and not a lot of room for entertaining, but somehow we made it all work for Thanksgiving dinner (4 adults and 2 kids). Everything was delicious! And somehow the dishes all had a place in the fridge.

We took our kid to the Phoenix Zoo and met up with R and his family on Friday morning. R was one of the first people I met at NAU (he lived in a corner room of my freshman dorm) and has remained a close friend. A, R, and I all shared an apartment one year. This was my first time at this zoo, and first time meeting R's kids (besides video chat appearances). The walking paths around the zoo are all blacktop, which just seems oppressively hot for Phoenix most of the year. The temperatures reached the low 70s in late November, and I can't imagine what this zoo feels like in the summertime. We saw most of the African animals, rode the carousel, and then my kid had a meltdown after lunch. Glad we were with other parents, who totally understood the situation and were gracious to us having to split early.

Friday afternoon saw us hanging with my sister and her kid at [Tumbleweed Park](https://www.chandleraz.gov/explore/chandler-parks/guide/tumbleweed-park) (massive playgrounds!) and another dinner of leftovers. We packed the car relatively quickly on Saturday morning and said our goodbyes to Mom. Loaded up on gluten-free items at the ALDI grocery store and headed back on I-10/I-17 to Flagstaff for the final night of our trip. We stopped at a McDonald's to get our kid chicken nuggets (her first Happy Meal, I think). We're trying to get our toddler to eat a variety of foods and especially green vegetables, but mostly she subsists on a diet of chicken nuggets, pasta, and berries. "This is good food, mommy" she said at least once at the McD's table. _Sigh_.

We did some holiday shopping at the Flagstaff [Bookmans](https://bookmans.com/), one of my favorite Arizona establishments. I ended up acquiring [_Illmatic_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illmatic) (1994) and _[Hey What](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hey_What)_ (2021) to my vinyl collection, too. We stayed another night at A's house and I bought Thai food for everyone. A recommended _The Circle_ by Dave Eggers, plus _The Every_, that book's sequel. I'd like to finish one more novel before the year ends, so I'm going to give this series a shot.

The drive on I-40 between Flagstaff and Albuquerque is quite lovely. It is so remote. You get to see the painted desert, and many mountains and mesas. I am looking forward to future trips to Arizona, and more trips around the Southwest in general. We picked up our dog at my sister in-law's house on Sunday, and could tell she really missed us. It feels good to get back into our family's regular routine this week. I can't believe it is December already.

## Show some gratitude

Somewhat inspired by [Brandon's post, "Thankfulness"](https://krrd.ing/posts/thankfulness/), as well as the Thanksgiving holiday, I jotted down some thoughts.

I am grateful for where I live. I have a lovely view of the mountains outside the window where I am typing this. It is quite beautiful here. I'm thankful to be so close to the family I married into, and a day's trip to where my mom and sister live. I am getting to know my neighbors better and slowly finding my community here in Albuquerque.

I'm grateful for my job. The work is interesting. The work is challenging. The benefits at my org, including paid time off, are generous. My schedule plus the ability to work remote provides some flexibility my family needs. I am exercising regularly! Most of all, I get to work with some great people.

I am grateful for my little girl. Being a parent is my favorite job. The work is challenging. The work is rewarding. Every day is full of surprises.

I'm grateful for a couple things that I am realizing I may have taken for granted in the past: One is health. As I mentioned, I'm exercising regularly again. I'm also taking medication for my blood pressure, allergies, and mental health. The blood pressure thing was a little worrisome, then annoying, but my provider finally thinks I'm managing it well. I wish I didn't have to manage depression. But I'm thankful to be alive. I'm also grateful for literacy. I can't imagine what my life and work would look like without the ability to read or write. And tech/digital literacy, too. As so many transactions and so much _life_ happens online, I'm thankful for my curiosity and ability to modify my tools, sift through scammy bullshit, and discover some delightful and enriching things through the world wide web.

## Blogiversary

My blog has been running for a decade now. Friday the 29th was officially the tenth anniversary of my first post in 2014. I didn't really have a formal post planned for this, so I'm just tacking it on to the end of this one.

Some of these years are spare, where I only published a year-end reading list. I enjoy the frequency and cadence with which I am publishing now, and not confining myself to a set of topics or a format. I still feel like my blogging is an experiment, but I do notice that style and consistency is becoming more important to me as I continue to write. I might someday document a formal style guide for my blog and writing.

I am in the process of redesigning my site and moving back to a static site generator. I won't share much more for now, but I did write some loose thoughts earlier this year about [the future of this website](/posts/2024-the-future-of-this-website/). As they say, it will be ready when it's ready.

I hope I can continue to write and publish regularly for another ten years (at least). I'm still astounded by folks like [Rachel Andrew](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/) and [Eric Meyer](https://meyerweb.com/) who have had their writing on the web for two or three decades (before _weblog_ was shortened to _blog_). It's cool to finally have ten consecutive years (an archive!) of posts under my belt, and I wonder what I'll be reading, writing and thinking about into my late forties (and beyond...)
