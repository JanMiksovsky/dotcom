It seems like an exciting time to be a flag designer in North America. Several states in the U.S. are adopting or considering new flag designs. Here are some you may have heard about:

- [Utah unveiled a new design](https://flag.utah.gov/) for a state flag earlier this year, doing away with a complicated seal and keeping its iconic beehive in front of a mountain backdrop.

- Mississippi was the most recent state to change it's flag, removing a design with the Confederate battle flag and flying a [new banner with a magnolia blossom and 'In God We Trust](https://usflags.design/mississippi/)'

- [Illinois' governor signed a bill](https://www.illinois.gov/news/press-release.26847.html) to explore the creation of a new state flag by the end of 2024.

- Massachusetts is also exploring a new [flag, seal, and state motto](https://www.masslive.com/news/2022/05/massachusetts-commission-unanimously-votes-to-recommend-the-change-of-state-flags-seal-and-motto.html).

- Minnesota invited residents to submit new flag and seal designs to replace its current emblems. [Submissions totaled over 2,600 entries](https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/minnesota-state-flag-redesign-panel-receives-more-than-2600-submissions/).

It looks like Allan Peters submitted three unique designs for Minnesota, which he shared on social media this week. [One of them is packed with symbolism](https://dribbble.com/shots/22944646-Minnesota-State-Flag-Redesign-Option-1), which I really like. The pines, wildflower, North Star, parks, water, snow: itâ€™s all there.

Lynn Fisher maintains [usflags.design](https://usflags.design/), a website devoted to the flags of U.S. states and territories. For each flag there is a breakdown of the colors, smbols, and design elements, plus a history of flags for each state. Glancing at each page on this site, I'm kind of surprised how often these symbols do get updated. This will be a valuable resource in the years to come as the landscape changes with more new flags.

Overall, I'm in favor of states updating their symbols. I'd personally like to see more flags with complicated seals (like my birthplace, [New York](https://usflags.design/new-york/)) be updated with streamlined designs inclusive of the people who live in the state. Seeing something new as you travel someplace new is kind of exciting. As every designer knows, you won't make everyone happy, and I do wonder what these changes could mean during a time of intense political division.
