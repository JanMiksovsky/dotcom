_The following took place in Knoxville, Tenn. in the 2010s._

There were no shortage of groups I could walk with in the city's Martin Luther King, Jr. Day parade, due to my liberal/progressive/_left-of-whatever_ affiliations. MLK Day always seemed to fall on the coldest morning of the year in Knoxville, so showing up to march or watch the parade seemed especially important.

For logisitcs, I was driving a group of marchers from the end of the parade route toward the beginning so no one in our group would have to walk the whole length twice in the cold. We ended up behind the garbage truck, watching the workers emptying the cans in the street into the truck. I can't remember which one of us pointed it out. _"Wasn't King killed during an action for sanitation workers in Tennessee?"_

A popular sign you see at MLK Day marches reads **Martin's Dream is Forever**. More than 50 years after his death, so much what he prophesied in the 1960s is still unrealized and unfulfilled. Of all days, why was King's birthday a holiday for the office workers, but not the sanitation workers? Later that evening, at a potluck banquet we attended, [Rev. Harold Middlebrook](https://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entries/harold-middlebrook/) shared his recollections of the [Poor People's Campaign](https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/poor-peoples-campaign). Before King's assassination, the plan was to continue the action in Memphis across the state in East Tennessee.

Attending that march and banquet that year influenced my decision to get more involved with the [labor union](https://ucw-cwa.org/) at my work. The governor of our state at the time was trying to outsource the custodians and facilities management at all state universities to a private firm. Being in the labor union was a valuable experience. I learned about _solidarity_ and building power.
