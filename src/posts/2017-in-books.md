In trying to understand this current moment historically, my reading interests skewed sharply toward books on power and politics beginning in late 2016. I wonder how common that is during elections, or during a presidential transition.

I continue to track my reading activity with Goodreads. In 2017, I discovered Overdrive, an ebook and audiobook service available at my local public library. I was using Audible (the one credit every other month subscription) and the addition of this app accelerated by audiobook consumption. I also took several long car trips in 2017 and stayed entertained with some of the audio titles.

I tend to keep multiple books going at a time, reading paper during the day, an e-reader at night, and listening to audiobooks while waiting on the bus, walking the dog, or washing the dishes after dinner.

Again, not all of these books are endorsements. I did read a bunch of recent bestseller or zeitgeist-y books, but these were not necessarily my favorites. I'll use a ⭐ star emoji to denote books I thoroughly enjoyed or would recommend. I'll also use emoji to denote whether I read each item on this list as a 📖 paper book, 📱ebook,  or listened as 🎧 audio.
