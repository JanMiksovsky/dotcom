[Clip of Kenny Shopsin: "You're not so terrific and that's OK"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dQjsil6vl8)

Not sure if it was all the 20th anniversary coverage of Sept. 11, but I felt like watching the 2004 documentary _I Like Killing Flies_ this week. The film is about famed NYC cook Kenny Shopsin and his idiosyncratic family-run restaurant Shopsin's General Store. The film is not so much about the trauma of 9/11 in Lower Manhattan but the casualties of the real estate trends that change a neighborhood's character. In this case, the gentrification of Greenwich Village in the late 1990s/early 2000s.

Eve Shopsin passed away during the making of the documentary, and Kenny died in 2018, but [the restaurant is still around](https://www.shopsins.com/), run by some of the kids at the Essex Market on the Lower East Side. Covid can't keep the Shopsin clan down, and their website says they are doing take-out and delivery (something you could not get in the 2002/3 incarnation of Shopsin's) to stay open.

I went in the Essex Market in 2014 trying to find the place, but I must have walked past the booth--I read it was tiny. There are a ton of vendors and its easy to get lost in the place. Not sure if I was secretly hoping to get kicked out by the famously cantankerous waitstaff or secretly relieved I saved myself the embarrassment of trying to fit in.

Not being in New York and able to eat at the place today, I could read daughter Tamara Shopsin's graphic memoir, _[Arbitrary Stupid Goal](https://www.tamarashopsin.com/asgfaq/#/)_. It's about growing up in a larger than life family and the disappearing way of life of her 1970s/80s West Village childhood. Or I can pick up [_Eat Me: The Food and Philosophy of Kenny Shopsin_](https://tastecooking.com/the-zen-of-ken/), a cookbook that advises you not to follow the recipes too closely.

Essential reading is [Calvin Trillin's 2002 _New Yorker_ profile](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/04/15/dont-mention-it) of Kenny and Eve and Shopsin's General Store.
