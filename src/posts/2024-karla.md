![Day 11: Karla](images/26Days-K-Karla-1024x576.png)

I just can't get enough of these quirky-looking grotesques. This time around we're looking at [Karla](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Karla), an open-source design by Jonny Pinhorn and released by Google Fonts in 2012. After Google, Pinhorn went on to the [Indian Type Foundry](https://www.indiantypefoundry.com/) (ITF), and is now at [Dalton Maag](https://www.daltonmaag.com/about/our-people.html).

Is it just me, or do the oblique/italic styles take on a more condensed appearance?

As far as free fonts go, this one has a bit of personality and is full of quirks. One of these is the spacing and [kerning](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/kerning_kerning_pairs) seem a bit off. In spite of these imperfections, it's one I've seen all [over the web](https://www.typewolf.com/karla) for the last decade, and I seem to not get sick of it. I dig the circular forms in the punctuation and dots of the **i** and **j**. The **a**, **g**, **6**, **9**, and the **&** all have a bit of a bouncy, playful feel to them.

Oh, a music player UI. Isn't that cute.

Karla was forked into a [project called Karmilla](https://github.com/ms-studio/karmilla) to support more languages. Because this is an open source design that has been around for a while, you're likely to find Karla in a lot of templates and free WordPress themes, etc. If you're looking for something with a similar vibe (and better kerning), try one of these:

- [Basic Sans](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/basic-sans) by Latinotype.

- [Maple](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/maple) by Process Type Foundry.

- [Roc Grotesk](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/roc-grotesk) by KostiÄ‡ Type Foundry.

- [Work Sans](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/work-sans) by Wei Huang.

## Pairs well with...

I think Karla is better off as a text face supporting a funky (or chunky) headline. With this sans-serif, you have a lot of options.

- Heaver weights of [Windsor](https://www.myfonts.com/collections/windsor-font-urw), [Cooper](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/new-kansas), [Fraunces](https://fraunces.undercase.xyz/), etc.

- High contrast serifs like [Gloock](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Gloock) or [Noe Display](https://www.schick-toikka.com/noe-display).

- Weird monospaced fonts like [Martian Mono](https://evilmartians.com/products/martian-mono) or [Space Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Space+Mono).

- Big condensed sans-serifs (in all caps), like [League Gothic](https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/league-gothic), [Druk](https://commercialtype.com/catalog/druk), or [Knockout](https://www.typography.com/fonts/knockout/overview).
