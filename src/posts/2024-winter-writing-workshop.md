I look forward to joining my [Wiggle Work pals](https://wiggle.work/) again in a wintertime writing challenge. This year instead of a daily blog post in February (we chose the shortest month of the year intentionally), this year’s challenge is a bit simpler and more inclusive: [One weekly post every Wednesday in January](https://wiggle.work/blog/writing-workshop-2025/).

The first Wednesday in January happens to be the first day of the year. At the beginning of 2024 I tried challenging myself to write for a few minutes each day (write, not necessarily post). There’s certainly days I missed, but overall I am really thankful for this practice. I don’t think I’ll ever think of myself as a Writer (I’m fine with being a Blogger), but spending the time to translate my thoughts into words has made me a better thinker and communicator.

My blogging output during last February’s challenge resulted in a series I called 26 Days of Type. I was surprised how many people seemed to like it, and I got some fun responses. The [Darden Studio type foundry](https://www.dardenstudio.com/) even shared one of my posts!

A couple of our bloggers kept up with a nearly daily cadence throughout the year. After 29 days of writing about type I was happy to move on to other topics. I am not yet sure exactly what I will do for January (there are 5 Wednesdays in January, by the way), but I am committed to publishing something new on the blog on January 1.

It’s not too late to join us, by the way. [Wiggle Work](https://wiggle.work/) is a laid back virtual community (we use Discord) of remote tech workers run by [Joni Trythall](https://jonitrythall.com/) and a few volunteers. We have a friendly application process and a code of conduct too. The <strong>#writing-workshop</strong> channel is where the discussions, drafts, and sharing of our blog posts happens, and it is all very positive and supportive. Even if joining an online community isn’t quite your thing, I would love to know if you are planning to embark on any similar writing challenges this upcoming year.
