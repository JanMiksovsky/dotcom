![Day 21: Upright Italics](images/26Days-U-Upright-Italics-1024x576.png)

I've been attempting to show italic and oblique styles for most of the type I'm featuring in the [26 Days of Type](https://nicksimson.com/26-days-of-type/) series this month. [Italic type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italic_type) was historically influenced by cursive and calligraphic script, and began to be widely used in the sixteenth century. Owing to the influence of calligraphy, most italic forms slant toward the right and often take on a more condensed appearance from their upright Roman counterparts.

> In general, italics tend to slant between 4–14 degrees. Most contemporary fonts slant between 6–9 degrees.

Since the italic form is used for emphasis and takes on a different appearance, sometimes there is no slant. These are called **upright italics**, and they are rare.

Literata (below) is recognizable in its upright italic form, compared to the more traditional slanted italics of Georgia.

[Literata](https://www.type-together.com/literata-font) was designed by Irene Vlachou, Veronika Burian, Vera Evstafieva, and José Scaglione at [TypeTogether](https://www.type-together.com/). The typeface was commissioned by Google in 2014 for the Google Play Book eReader and application. Literata is a hyrbrid between old-style and Scotch Roman genres. On the subject of the italics:

> The secondary style is an upright italic, meaning that the letter shapes have an italicised construction and & no slant to speak of. Albeit rather uncommon in screen-fonts, this kind of genre addresses some of the inherent limitations of the square pixel grid. Moreover the resulting unusual italic adds high branding value to Literata making it unique, recognisable and easy to remember.

I particularly love the texture Literata's italic makes with that repeating slope found in letters like **a**, **g**, **h**, **n**, **m**, **r**, and **u**. [I used it on my website from 2020-2023](https://nicksimson.com/posts/2020-redesign-webfonts-html/) and previously described this italic form as the font's "killer feature."

[Seria and Seria Sans](https://www.martinmajoor.com/3_seria.html) by Martin Majoor also feature upright italics. These fonts feature a lower x-height and long ascenders/descenders, compared to his earlier [Scala type family](https://www.martinmajoor.com/1_scala.html). Seria takes some inspiration from Dutch type designer Jan van Krimpen’s designs, including Romanée.

> In Seria Italic Majoor has taken this same unusual approach, though his upright italic stemmed from a functional need, and was not meant as an homage to Van Krimpen. As Majoor explains it, in the mid-1990s a French designer had planned to set a book in Scala, but because of the complexity of the text, had the rare need for two distinct but related italics. The designer asked Majoor if a second Scala Italic could be drawn with a more extreme slope. Seeing that it would not be feasible to redraw the existing face, Majoor chose to implement the concept of two related italics – one nearly upright and one more normally inclined – in the fledgling Seria family. Seria Italic was then drawn upright in the Romanée fashion while Seria Cursive, which has not yet been published, is a more traditionally sloped letter.

As there's only a small number of digital typefaces with upright italics, there are similarly only a few [entries for upright italics on Fonts in Use](https://fontsinuse.com/tags/8483/upright-italic). Its a form and a variety I'd love to see more of in the world.

Literata has been available from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Literata) since 2020. [Seria](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/seria) and [Seria Sans](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/seria-sans) are available from Adobe Fonts.
