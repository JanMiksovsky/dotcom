[James tagged me in a recent post](https://jamesg.blog/2025/01/16/creative-questions-challenge/) to respond to a set of prompts on the topic of **creativity**. I enjoyed thinking about each prompt, and I got kind of wordy! My answers are below.

&nbsp;

## What creative activities do you do often?

First of all I work a job that could be described as ‚Äúcreative.‚Äù I‚Äôm a user interface (UI) designer and work on digital web/software products. I formally trained as a graphic designer, and as web designer my background is a mixture of self-taught/on-the-job learning. I am still constantly learning and working to keep up with the web platform. Outside of work I occasionally I create logos and graphics and websites for other people, and also for my own learning and enjoyment.

I feel like this is important to state here: I don‚Äôt think one needs a professional title or formal training to give themselves permission to create! I‚Äôve been incredibly lucky to be a full time ‚Äúcreative‚Äù for close to fifteen years, but some of my favorite creative work is done by hobbyist or self-taught artists and designers.

My other main creative outlet is writing. I try to write for a few minutes each day, and I publish things on my blog regularly. I‚Äôve had my blog for a decade now, and I am using it more and more these days. I don‚Äôt know how ‚Äúgood‚Äù my writing is, but I feel like it sharpens my thinking, and once in a while people say polite things. This month I joined a [creative challenge](https://wiggle.work/blog/writing-workshop-2025/) to publish something once a week.

## What creative activities would you like to do more often?

I used to draw a lot more for fun. I took drawing classes and studio art in college before my studies really focused on graphic design. My sketchbooks these days are full of rough wireframes for websites and digital components, logo ideas, and other doodles. They‚Äôre kind of boring! I‚Äôd like to get back into drawing and using markers or colored pencils, and maybe even some rudimentary printmaking I could do at home.

I am also trying to get back in the habit of playing guitar and mandolin more often. My spouse plays violin and we have some friends who jam with us. We play a mix of traditional acoustic music plus contemporary songs. I‚Äôve never really attempted to write my own music or lyrics though. I‚Äôm not sure what exactly is holding me back.

&nbsp;

## What environments do you like to create in? How does this differ between the different creative things you do?

Our home is a creative environment. Each part of the house is set up for a different creative activity. I‚Äôm married to an artist. Her painting studio is a separate building on our property, and she also works at a desk in our bedroom making miniatures. Our living room is where we play music.

I have a home office with desk where I keep my laptop, monitor, and printer. I work facing a big window with a decent view of [the mountains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandia_Mountains). Artwork done by family and friends surrounds me on the walls, and I store my guitars in the office as well. I‚Äôm in there during the work day and use my space for after-hours creating too.

We also have a kid (nearly three years old). She has a little space she calls her ‚Äústudio‚Äù for painting (she uses washable paints!) and Play-Doh, Duplo blocks, coloring books, and puzzles. Creative play spreads through the whole house and yard, and it is so fun to see her imagination at work.

I do leave the house once in a while üòÅ, but I‚Äôve never really tried writing or working in a coffee shop or co-working space. I find environments outside of the home a bit distracting, but I do carry a little notebook when I‚Äôm out and about.

&nbsp;

## Do you have a consistent time that you make things, or do you prefer to go with the flow?

With work and family responsibilities, I have to be pretty intentional about how I use my time. My weekday routine involves waking early to make breakfast for the family, and getting to my desk at 7am. I like to spend part of my lunch hour writing for myself. These days I‚Äôm mainly writing in Apple Notes, since iCloud syncs between my computer and my phone. I find myself tapping out little notes and ideas on my phone during other parts of the day.

My work day ends at 3pm when my daughter comes home, at which point I‚Äôm ‚Äúon the clock‚Äù for family stuff until 7pm or later. Depending on how tired I am, I might squeeze in an hour for personal projects, but most of this gets pushed to the weekend. I‚Äôm lucky to get one morning or afternoon to myself on the weekend to work on my own stuff, and I try to make the most of this time.

&nbsp;

## How much time do you spend taking notes and gathering inspiration before you make something new?

Quite a bit, although I never tried to quantify this. Inspiration can come from many sources. I use my website as a digital scrapbook, collecting quotes from stuff I‚Äôm reading online or in books as ‚Äò[notes](/notes/)‚Äô on my blog. I‚Äôve also been using [are.na](https://www.are.na/nick-simson/channels) to bookmark visual inspiration for years. It‚Äôs handy to have a system of tags or channels to quickly pull ideas from disparate sources. The work I do always has some kind of constraints, and those usually dictate the outcome. But it‚Äôs handy to have a file of color inspiration, interesting fonts, or UI ideas ready when a new project requires it.

## What does the term ‚Äúcreative practice‚Äù mean to you?

I equate the words ‚Äúcreative practice‚Äù with **discipline**. Again, I‚Äôm married to a painter. She is the most disciplined person I know. She has a consistent studio practice, shows up, and gets stuff done every week. I try to follow the example she sets. We try to keep creative people in our orbit as well. Being in conversation with others helps fuel my creativity. SMS and video calls and the internet is kind of amazing, as we can be in touch with our pals all over the world.

I‚Äôm working to be a little more clued in to what‚Äôs happening in my city and region, but this is challenging with raising a child! As a family, we make time to visit museums, and go to art shows, and (once in a blue moon) catch live music. We go on hikes and look for interesting rocks. We arrange play dates with our kid and go to library story times. We have conversations about what we‚Äôre reading, watching, listening to, and noticing as we go about the day.

I talked about environment already, but having artwork and books and music I love is so important to me. I have a digital music subscription and a library card, but I make room to own physical copies of the music and books I return to again and again. We‚Äôre not minimalists and we‚Äôre very privileged to have a whole house to keep this stuff. But no matter how much or how little space one has, everyone deserves at least a little corner for creativity.
