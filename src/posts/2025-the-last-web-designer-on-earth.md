“I’m a web designer.” Elly Loel states simply in [her blog post](https://www.ellyloel.com/blog/front-end-development-s-identity-crisis/) from March last year.

>I’m designing for the web. The infinitely flexible web. The web that doesn’t have one screen size, one browser, one operating system, or one device. The web that can be used by anyone, anywhere, on any internet connection, on any device, on any operating system, on any browser, with any screen size. I’m designing with the web. Using the web platform (HTML, CSS, JS, ARIA, etc.), not a bloated harmful abstraction. I have a deep understanding of HTML and its semantics. I love CSS, I know how and when to utilise its many features, and I keep up-to-date as more are added. I have a strong understanding of modern JavaScript and most importantly I know when not to use it.

It’s a beautiful description of the job, and I do hope more people start calling themselves **web designers** again.

Ten, fifteen years ago, “WordPress specialist” was something I could have seen myself making a career of. I’m still thankful for the WordPress project for getting me interested in open source, and consequently developing skills to not rely on WP forever.

Let me talk (again) about the [very public and ugly WordPress drama](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/mullenweg-says-lawsuits-could-end-wordpress/537336/) for a minute. I can only describe this situation as a failure of governance. I’m watching the situation unfold, and each week’s chapter makes me hesitant to recommend the platform in the near term.

Staring at the <code>/wp-admin</code> dashboard no longer sparks joy. I currently work in a Drupal shop, and haven’t used WordPress for work for a couple years now. I’m in the process of moving this personal website and blog to a static site, and my wife and I are looking at alternatives for managing her art portfolio.

I’m not ruling out a future of ever using WP again, but it’s a community I no longer feel invested in. I’m reminding myself that I have met some outstanding people through the years, and no matter where we find ourselves now, we all still exist as people outside of our contributions.

Professionally, I’m following the “generalist” path for the foreseeable future. And “web designer” best describes this path for me.

The core web design skills, especially as Elly described them are transferable across CMS platforms, teams of different sizes and makeup, and tech stacks. I have the tools and software I’m more comfortable with, but also plenty of things I’m curious about.

Now I lean toward what Jared White described as “closer-to-the-metal forms of web development” in his [Great Gaslighting of the JavaScript Era](https://www.spicyweb.dev/the-great-gaslighting-of-the-js-age/) post. I am not interested in needless complexity, or ways of working against [the grain](https://frankchimero.com/blog/2015/the-webs-grain/) of the web platform. The goal is to ship a [resilient](https://resilientwebdesign.com/) front end, always. There are still lots of things I need to learn deeply. I want to get better at my **craft**.

I’ll be turning 38 this year. In all likelihood I’m looking at a few more decades of working. I still enjoy this web platform I grew up with, and which grew up with me. I still believe in the promise of an inclusive, accessible web, but I’m afraid the idea is at odds with the larger Tech Industry these days. An Industry that is chewing up workers and spitting them out.

I can’t predict the future, but there are a few things that make me uneasy about the [current job market](https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2024/the-one-about-the-web-developer-job-market/). I want to continue to lean into my core skills and avoid chasing too many trends. Focusing on craft is my plan for [surviving the AI-pocalypse](https://www.spicyweb.dev/surviving-the-ai-pocalypse/). That and being a [Luddite](/posts/2024-call-me-a-luddite.html).

Will I still be writing **web designer** on my tax forms in twenty years? Time will tell.
