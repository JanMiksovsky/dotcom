_Bookmarked [Web Design Engineering With the New CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su6WA0kUUJE) by Matthias Ott._

The [video for Matthias Ott's CSS Day 2024 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=su6WA0kUUJE) is up. He reiterates a sentiment he shared in a [blog post from June last year](https://matthiasott.com/notes/the-new-css), and one I agree with:

> CSS is now the most powerful design tool for the Web.

Matthias' argument, shared by others, is that the features landing in CSS today are outpacing [the subset of CSS used in visual design tools](https://vasilis.nl/nerd/our-web-design-tools-are-holding-us-back/) like Sketch, Figma, and Adobe XD. He backs this up by demonstrating several examples of typography, color, and layout using newer CSS features introduced in the 2020s.

I personally began learning both Photoshop and CSS around the same time (circa 2005), and have certainly mocked up my share of websites and UI in visual tools. Nowadays I spend a bit of time in Sketch and Figma, and occasionally Webflow, but I've long been an adherent of **designing in the browser**.

> If we are not using the platform as our design material, we are breaking the feedback loop.

Working in the browser early gets me thinking about how things should look and behave and (maybe most importantly) fail, as I try to build [resilient websites](https://resilientwebdesign.com/). For that reason, [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) is a beautiful design tool. Not everything I create in CodePen is production-quality, and that's OK! I mainly use CodePen to design rough-and-ready working prototypes for isolated components.

 <blockquote>
  <p>...<strong>Treat code as disposable, especially when you are learning</strong>. You’re just building websites, friend. It’s all good to be rough around the edges. The web is rough around the edges!</p>
  <p>One benefit of learning to code is you will find that the more you let the browser do its thing, the better your output will be...</p>
  <p>...The thing to remember about learning HTML and CSS is that they are <strong>web standards</strong> and will long outlive Figma, Adobe XD and Sketch. At worst, learning to code will help you communicate with developers much better. At best, your design skills will be much more rounded and relevant in an ever-changing and expanding industry.</p>

After watching Matthias' talk, there are plenty of new features I need to get acquainted with and am excited to begin trying out. And I may need to brush up on my high school math, too.

The best artists are deeply knowledgeable of the **material** they work with. Their tools may not be much more sophisticated that what you have in your home or garage. For too long in my career I've watched designers and developers (and job descriptions) obsess over their tooling, rather than understanding and _knowing_ the web platform deeply.
