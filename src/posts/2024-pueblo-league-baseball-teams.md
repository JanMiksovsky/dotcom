I visited the [Indian Pueblo Cultural Center](https://indianpueblo.org/) in Albuquerque this week to check out the museum exhibits, and eat lunch at the incredible [Indian Pueblo Kitchen](https://indianpueblokitchen.org/). One of the current exhibits (up until October) is called [Pueblo League Baseball: Stitching Our Community Together](https://indianpueblo.org/current_exhibitions/pueblo-baseball-stitching-our-community-together/).

I checked out a book on [New Mexico's Pueblo Baseball League](https://www.arcadiapublishing.com/products/9781467132800/?queryID=b3c8bf6f359a384661bd7f14aaf432b7&objectID=9781467132800&insightsIndex=arcadia-publishing_products) from the library earlier this month, which also features some great photography, albeit in black and white. The IPCC exhibit has a lot more contemporary full color photography, as well as a short documentary featuring some of the teams and players.

 <blockquote>
  <p>Baseball in the pueblos began about 1900, at Isleta, where players competed with local Hispanic village teams and mining company teams along the Rio Grande. Eventually, Pueblo teams competed in Albuquerque leagues, as there were no other Pueblo teams playing baseball in the areaâ€¦Pueblo baseball has grown to include as many as 32 teams in two leagues, and the game is still growing.</p>

It was interesting to see the gloves, bats, jerseys, and the tournament schedules from the various Pueblo teams, historical and contemporary. Sometimes the team names are inspired by MLB teams. Other popular professional and college team names are used, while other names are wholly original. I collected some of my favorite team names from both the book and exhibit below. Not a complete list by any means, but these are just fun to read.

- Cochiti Braves
- Cochiti Dukes
- Destroyers (Ohkay Owingeh?)
- Horned Frogs (Laguna/Acoma/Mesita)
- Isleta Suns
- Jemez Hawks
- Jemez Longhorns
- Jemez Sun Devils
- Lady Braves Softball (Albuquerque and Santa Fe Indian School teams)
- Laguna Earth/Wind/Fire
- Laguna Heat
- Laguna Monarchs
- Mesita Demons
- Paguate Bandits
- San Felipe Giants (this team also wears an interlocking SF similar to the San Francisco Giants)
- Sandia Hawkeyes
- Santa Ana Nakonas
- Santo Domingo Padres
- Seama Bad Company
- Seama Rush
- Tesuque Rangers
- Tamaya Tigers (Pueblo Little League)
- Walatowa Mets

I checked out a couple other baseball books focusing on New Mexico and the Southwest, and this has been a fun way to learn a little more local history this summer.
