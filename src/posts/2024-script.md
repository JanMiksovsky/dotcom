![Day 19: Script Typefaces](images/26Days-S-Script-1024x576.png)

The [script classification](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/script_typeface_style) describes typefaces that are based on handwriting or calligraphy. In this way, it feels a bit like the [geometric classification](https://nicksimson.com/posts/geometric/) to me, since all type is based on handwriting or calligraphic forms. It's not to be confused with the term ["script" as it applies to writing systems](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/script_writing_system).

In the Latin writing system, a script typeface generally takes on one of two sub-classifications: **formal** and **casual**. Quality digital script fonts should feature carefully designed ligatures, swashes, alternates, and other features so the quality of the type output looks calligraphic and handcrafted.

![Formal and Casual styles compared](images/26Days-S-Script-styles-1024x576.png)

Most of our modern formal script fonts (think formal cursive invitations) are derived from a form of handwriting with a quill or a metal pen nib popular throughout the 17th, 18th and into the early 19th centuries. This style is called [round hand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round_hand), and many of the font names ([Bickham](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/bickham-script), [Snell](https://www.myfonts.com/collections/snell-roundhand-script-font-linotype)) come from the names of the people who perfected this form of handwriting. [Chancery hand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chancery_hand) is an earlier form of handwriting performed with similar technology, but much different letterforms.

Casual scripts were popularized in the 20th century, and the letterforms look as though they were executed by a brush, or sometimes a chiseled felt marker. There's a lot of variety in this sub-genre of script. A few notable examples:

- [Cortado](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/cortado) by XYZ Type

- [Lakeside](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/lakeside) by Mark Simonson

- [Learning Curve](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/learning-curve) by Jess Latham

- [Relation](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/relation) by Jess Latham

- [Voltage](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/voltage) by Laura Worthington

There's a lot more variety than these examples. Once again, I'm only scratching the surface in this post. One of my favorite sub-sub-genres is the baseball script, a kind of display script you usually see on athletic uniforms, usually with a decorative swash underlining the city or team name.

Scripts are good for display type, headings, or short lines of text, but can be a bit unwieldy and difficult to read at small text sizes or in paragraphs. Use your best judgment. Oh, and look out for stuff like this:
