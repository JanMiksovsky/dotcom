I recently finished reading [<i>So Many Ways to Lose: The Amazin’ True Story of the New York Mets—The Best Worst Team in Sports</i>](https://bookshop.org/p/books/so-many-ways-to-lose-the-amazin-true-story-of-the-new-york-mets-the-best-worst-team-in-sports-devin-gordon/13103582?ean=9780062940025) by Devin Gordon.

You rarely see the words “Mets fan” without the adjective “long-suffering” preceding it. <i>So Many Ways to Lose</i> is a history and meditation on the New York Mets that could only be written by a real fan.

I grew up in upstate New York surrounded by Yankees fans. In grade school when it was time to choose allegiances in professional sports, I picked the Mets over the Yankees. Although they weren’t the best in the early 1990s, I liked the more colorful orange and blue, and had a lot of respect and admiration for Hall of Famer Tom Seaver (still do). I liked that [the Beatles played at their stadium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6DfG7sml-Q). I loved the stories from the World Series wins in 1969 and 1986, and I would be rewarded later as a fan when catcher and slugger Mike Piazza came over from the Dodgers and the team made it to the Subway Series in 2000.

The Mets may have had one of the [worst seasons in professional baseball history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_worst_Major_League_Baseball_season_win%E2%80%93loss_records), but they are not the worst team in professional sports. Devin Gordon’s argument is that they are the *best* worst team. The Mets win when they should lose, and lose when they should win. They are *gifted at losing*. There is more joy rooting for a team that is full of surprises.

<i>So Many Ways to Lose</i> does cover the World Series wins, but there are entire separate books you can read about those victories. Gordon uses those wins to set the stage for future mistakes, or to more closely examine what was going on off the field. Avoiding any sepia-toned nostalgia, the author spends a lot of effort trying to get the history right. After the departure of the Giants and Dodgers to California in the 1950s, New York got a National League franchise again thanks to the efforts of Joan Whitney Payson. But her legacy was all but erased due to outright sexism and the egos of later owners. The most heartbreaking chapter, “The Voyage of the Clotilda” details the racist treatment star hitter [Cleon Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleon_Jones) experienced in New York in the 60s and 70s.

The most entertaining chapter is one devoted to [Endy Chavez and an unforgettable play](https://youtu.be/KXuGz0o_DVg?feature=shared) he made in the 6th inning of the 7th game of the 2006 National League Championship Series. This play may very well have surpassed [“The Catch” by Willie Mays](https://www.mlb.com/news/willie-mays-the-catch) in the 1954 World Series…had the Mets gone on to actually win the game in the 9th inning. But this is a book about losing, and this document perhaps best supports the “gifted at losing” thesis Gordon presents.

<i>So Many Ways to Lose</i> is a must-read for Mets fans, and a curiosity for any sports fan, serious or casual. As self-deprecating about the Mets as Gordon is, he also gets a lot of digs in at other franchises, so if you don’t have a sense of humor about your own team, you may not like this book as much.
