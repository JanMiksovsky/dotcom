I recently finished reading _[Big Day Coming: Yo La Tengo and the Rise of Indie Rock](https://bookshop.org/a/21729/9781592407156)_ by Jesse Jarnow (ISBN: 9781101588680).

December 2, 2024 will mark the 40th anniversary of [Yo La Tengo](https://yolatengo.com/) performing their first concert under that name. Later that month, Georgia Hubley, Ira Kaplan, and James McNew will likely play sold-out shows for all eight nights of Hanukkah with countless friends and guest performers, a tradition they begun in 2001 at [Maxwell's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell's) in Hoboken, and continue in Brooklyn each year. Another notable band tradition is an annual marathon taking live requests over the air at WFMU where the band participates in the radio station's fundraising drive.

I've been aware of these things as a casual fan of Yo La Tengo since the early 2000s. The _Summer Sun_ album and compilation _Prisoners of Love_ were my introduction to this band, bought at Gopher Sounds, Flagstaff's independent CD store during that era. Although I had several of their mp3s on my hard drive prior to that. Last year's _This Stupid World_ brought me back into YLT's orbit and back catalogue: By far they were the most played artist on my Last.fm account in the last 12 months.

I've never seen the band live, though there have been near-misses. I picked up Jesse Jarnow's book _Big Day Coming_ from my public library this spring, curious to learn more about the group's history. You won't read any lurid tales of trashed hotel rooms or drug overdoses in this rock and roll book—Georgia and Ira were more interested in attending an afternoon baseball game or taking their crew to a hole-in-the-wall soul food joint while on tour.

This wholesomeness may be the secret to the band's longevity, as well as carving out their niche in indie rock. Yo La Tengo started out touring in a hand-me-down Buick station wagon, and built a career eschewing excess and celebrating fandom: the band's extensive covers include the most obscure singles and B-sides from the 60s and 70s; the New York Mets inspired their name; they even [wrote a song around a throwaway Troy McClure line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBZPaYUGP6o) from _The Simpsons_.

Jarnow's book shares exhaustive details behind the albums and songs from the 1980s up to around 2010. I enjoyed learning the origin stories behind each active member: Ira turned his encyclopedic knowledge of music and fandom into a job as a rock journalist; Georgia was raised providing art and voice talent for her parents' independent filmmaking; James' early exposure to D. Boon and the Minutemen and his DIY roots in Charlottesville. There are also plenty of surprises. I was familiar with the [recording of YLT backing Daniel Johnston (on the telephone) for his song "Speeding Motorcycle"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bRvi8Zmmys) but didn't know until reading Jarnow's book that Johnston couldn't hear them!

The lasting impression I have from this book is how much the band's survival is dependent on relationships. From the outside, it might look like hipster insider-ism, but the working relationships between the artists and producers and promoters and radio DJs and label managers are friendships based on a shared love for music. At least in Jarnow's telling. Ira and Georgia's marriage has stayed intact, James has been the bass player for 30 of these 40 years, and Yo La Tengo shows no signs of calling it quits any time soon.
