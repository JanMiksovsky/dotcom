[Listen to Rachel Baiman’s wonderful version of this song](https://rachelbaimanmerch.bandcamp.com/track/self-made-man-3), originally penned by John Hartford. On this recording, Riley Calcagno is [playing a banjo that belonged to Hartford](https://www.facebook.com/Rachelbaimanmusic/posts/one-week-of-self-made-man-thanks-for-listening-yall-cant-wait-to-share-more-song/583626540250691/).

<blockquote>
<p>How many men do you think it takes, to make a self made man?<br/>
How many fingers must he step on, to do the best he can<br/>
Have you watched his eyes when he deals your cards<br/>
Do you know the other players in his life<br/>
Have you ever seen the bones his closet holds<br/>
Do you watch him when he sharpens his knife<br/>
How many men do you think it takes to make a self made man</p>

<p>Do you think you want to sit around and play a part, in the corner of his self made life<br/>
Stand by his side patiently, and try to be his perfect little wife<br/>
Will you tell him that he’s done everything right and that he should never take the blame<br/>
For the people cast off and trampled on, just because they got in his way<br/>
How many men do you think it takes to make a self made man</p>

<p>Don’t you wonder what he thinking when he holds your life in the palm of his money-stained hand<br/>
Don’t you wonder how long before you kick face down in the place in the place where you thought you used to stand</p>

<p>How many men do you think it takes to make a self made man<br/>
How many men do you think it takes to make a self made man<br/>
How many people do you think he’ll use to do the best he can<br/>
How hard will you run with your hair falling back to compete with a rolling stone<br/>
And track him down at all of the ports that he currently calls home<br/>
How many men do you think it takes to make a self made man</p>

<p>Don’t you wonder what he thinking when he holds your life in the palm of his money-stained hand<br/>
Don’t you wonder how long before you kick face down in the place where you thought you used to stand<br/>
How many men do you think it takes<br/>
How many men do you think it takes<br/>
How many men do you think it takes<br/>
How many men do you think it takes, to make a self made man?</p>
