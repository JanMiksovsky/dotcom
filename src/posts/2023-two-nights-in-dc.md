Had a quick trip to Washington, DC this week for a work meeting that also coincided with our org’s holiday party. A couple other highlights:

- Probably missed [Oprah Winfrey](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/13/entertainment/oprah-winfrey-smithsonian-portrait/index.html) by a couple hours at the National Portrait Gallery. I was one of the first Americans to see her new portrait that day, so I guess that’s something.

- Ate delicious wood-fired pizza at [Timber Pizza](https://www.timberpizza.com/).

- Met up with a friend I’ve known for nearly 20 years and hadn’t seen since literally right before the beginning of the pandemic. Caught up on some life changes, current events, and shared some good memories.

- Was randomly seated with two other New Mexicans on the flight from DCA to DFW on our way home. Got some great recommendations for more restaurants to try closer to home.
