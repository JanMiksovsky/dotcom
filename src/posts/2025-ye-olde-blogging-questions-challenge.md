I canâ€™t open my RSS reader anymore without seeing one of these. [Reilly](https://reillyspitzfaden.com/posts/2025/01/blog-tag-game/) did it. So did [Tracy](https://tracydurnell.com/2025/01/15/blog-questions-challenge/) and [Naz](https://nazhamid.com/journal/blog-questions/) and [Ethan](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/blog-questions-challenge/) and [Susan](https://www.susanjeanrobertson.com/writing/tag-youre-it/) too. I've read responses from [Katherine](https://kayserifserif.place/posts/2025/ive-been-tagged), [Rachel](https://kwon.nyc/notes/blog-questions-challenge/), and [Adam](https://notes.neatnik.net/2025/01/blog-question-challenge-2025). [Jeremy](https://adactio.com/journal/21674) gave us all permission to jump in, so I thought I would give these eight or so questions my own&nbsp;spin.

## Why did you start blogging in the first place?
I started my current blog at the end of 2014. I was still kind of early in my career and following a bunch of these great blogs by smart people figuring out this fairly new responsive web design thing. I thought it would be great to have a space where I too could show off what I was learning on the job and from reading all these wonderful resources. I donâ€™t write about technical topics as much as I thought I would when I started out, but Iâ€™m really happy where I ended&nbsp;up.

A lot of designers I looked up to had blogs and Twitter profiles, but I could also sense that something was cracking under the surface of Twitter itself (this was 2014, the year of the [Gamergate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamergate_(harassment_campaign)) harassment campaign). A lot of beloved sites and platforms were also disappearing or going dark, and I had kind of discovered a bunch of people reclaiming their own space on the web with this indie web ethos. I think I first heard about the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org) on [Jeffery Zeldmanâ€™s&nbsp;podcast](https://bigwebshow.fireside.fm/114).

## What platform are you using to manage your blog and why did you choose&nbsp;it?
Iâ€™m currently using a project called [Web Origami](https://weborigami.org/) to build my site, which I host on [Netlify](https://netlify.com). I really like having a simple file system for what is a bit of a sprawling web presence. In addition to longer [blog posts](/posts/index.html) Iâ€™m also publishing shorter [notes](/notes/index.html) (a microblog).

Origami is part programming language and part static site generator, and runs with NodeJS. Like other static site generators Iâ€™ve used, it's very flexible and allows you to customize the structure to your unique project. You can start pretty small and let things grow, rather than having to strip away parts of a project or templates you donâ€™t need. With some help, I was able get this to work the way my brain works, and I'm having a grand old time.

## Have you blogged on other platforms before?
Oh yes. I started my blog with Jekyll and GitHub Pages in 2014 and moved things to Eleventy in late 2020. I moved things to WordPress before this most recent redesign, and then just got a bad taste in my mouth with the lawsuits and drama with the founder in late 2024. It was a bummer because I kind of started my career with WordPress around 2012, and was even trying to go all in with the block editor and full site editing in 2023. Oh well.

Before WordPress, I tried microblogging with the Micro.blog platform. I also kept a Tumblr blog before that. And long, long ago I started some Blogger.com sites that thankfully never got saved by the Internet Archive.

## How do you write your posts? For example, in a local editing tool, or in a panel/dashboard thatâ€™s part of your blog?
I keep notes in the Apple Notes app. Itâ€™s the most reliable tech that syncs between my phone and laptop. I am curious to try tools like [Byword](https://www.bywordapp.com/) and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), but for now Apple Notes is working great. When Iâ€™m ready to format and publish, I start a new Markdown file in my <code>/posts</code> or <code>/notes</code> folder and go to town.

## When do you feel most inspired to&nbsp;write?
A lot of my blogging comes from reacting to things Iâ€™ve read online or encountered in the world. If thereâ€™s something I want to remember, I write that thing down. And if itâ€™s something I feel like sharing publicly, that becomes a blog post.

## Do you publish immediately after writing, or do you let it simmer a bit as a&nbsp;draft?
It depends. I donâ€™t think a lot about my micro notes before I publish. The things I would post on Bluesky or Mastodon now, often these are published as notes on my blog first. Sometimes I do the opposite though, saving these short posts to my blog later because I want to keep a copy.

Longer blog posts tend to simmer. Often times Iâ€™ll have two or three things in Apple Notes or a drafts folder and theyâ€™ll come together in one big long blog post.

## Whatâ€™s your favorite post on your blog?
I write to get thoughts out of my head, and once in a while these show up as public posts on my blog. I was really proud of "[Tool U Want](/posts/2024-tool-u-want.html)" which articulates a lot of things I would like in the ideal web publishing tool/platform (spoiler: it doesn't exist). I was genuinely surprised by the response "[Friction and resistance](/posts/2025-friction-and-resistance.html)" got after I published it last month. I attempted to [blog about typography every day](/26-days-of-type.html) for a month in 2024, and my favorite post from that series is the one on [Franklin Gothic](/posts/2024-franklin.html). I learned so much researching and writing that series.

## Any future plans for your blog? Maybe a redesign, a move to another platform, or adding a new feature?
I just moved house, so to speak, and spent so much time customizing this platform. I also removed a bit of functionality in this process, ditching a database and doing everything with flat files and a simple build process. My next steps are to clean up the CSS a bit and add a dark theme. I'm gonna think carefully and deliberately what features I want to implement next.

## Whoâ€™s next?
Anyone out there who has been resisting the pull of the Blog Questions Meme, for weeks now. The only way these posts will finally stop is when the last blogger remaining on earth succumbs to these cryptic questions and posts their own set of answers. You know you need to do this. Yes, I mean you. ðŸ«µ
