_Likes [Worrying About Bandcamp’s Future](https://pxlnv.com/linklog/worrying-about-bandcamp/) by Nick Heer._

> It is tempting for technologists to argue that we should create better ways for artists and writers and filmmakers and others to distance themselves from centralized platforms like these and become entirely independent. But I do not think that is what the world is calling for. It is not as though those products do not [already exist](https://newsroom.squarespace.com/blog/squarespace-for-musicians); the reality is that most people do not want to maintain a website...
...There need to be more platforms like these — “more internet”, as [Katie Notopoulos put it](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/10/17/1081194/how-to-fix-the-internet-online-discourse/). There should be requirements that user data is securely backed up, and that user data is also portable. If a musician does not like a platform’s new direction or they get a better deal somewhere else, it should be trivial for them to export their catalogue and migrate their mailing list, not a [silly hack](https://get.bandcamp.help/hc/en-us/articles/360007802354-I-lost-my-original-audio-files-Can-I-download-them-from-my-Bandcamp-account-). Platforms ought to have the confidence that they are doing so well for their users that a single-click migration button is seen as trust-building, not a risk.
