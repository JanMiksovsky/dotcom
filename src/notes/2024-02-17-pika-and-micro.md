Following up on [my last note](https://nicksimson.com/notes/realnice/), I'd probably recommend [Pika](https://pika.page/) to my pals who want to start their own blogs, but don't want to download or install anything, mess with plugins, etc. Just write.

Pika offers unlimited blog posts and pages on their $6 a month plan, which also includes some [simple theming](https://pika.pika.page/posts/themes-are-back-and-better-than-ever) (and custom CSS), image uploads, etc.

Then there's [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/) (starting at $5 a month) for some additional features plus being connected to another social network. I used this for a while and still like what [Manton](https://www.manton.org/) and his small team is doing.

Don't get me wrong. I still love WordPress and use it every day. It's just not for everyone out there, and there are easier and cheaper options for folks who don't need all the features. Matt Mullenweg himself mentioned that "WordPress.com is going to orient itself more towards developers" [in a blog post earlier this year](https://ma.tt/2024/01/automattics-big-re-org/), and I wonder what that is going to mean for the long term.
