Probably the best marketing for [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog) I've encountered in some time. With it's _understated_ UI, its easy to overlook how powerful and feature-rich this little platform is.

Any one of Micro.blog's many features (social networking, blog hosting, podcast hosting, cross-posting/syndication, bookshelves, bookmarks, highlighting, archiving web pages) could easily be spun into its own product, but I love the ethos of what [Manton](https://manton.org/) and the team are doing with their platform: Tying everything together under the open web.
