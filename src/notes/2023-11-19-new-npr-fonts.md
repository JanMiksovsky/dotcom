I noticed the typography on the [NPR website](https://www.npr.org/) was a bit different. Looks like they recently switched from open source fonts to something new.

In the CSS stylesheet these are named 'NPR sans' and 'NPR serif', but I can't find much else about these designs online. There's a lot of past reporting about other fonts from NPR in the search results, though.

NPR should consider doing a story if these are in fact commissioned fonts unique to the brand's voice.
