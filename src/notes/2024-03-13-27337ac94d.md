_Likes [Notes on facilitating technical discussions in meetups](https://jamesg.blog/2024/03/04/facilitating-technical-discussions/) by James._

> A significant part of my responsibilities as host is ensuring that everyone feels included. Nobody wants to join a meetup that they think is interesting and then feel like they don't quite fit in. For this to happen on the account of perceived knowledge one must have -- often an impression made by discussions being too technical, or using too much in-speak -- is a failure. Not everybody will enjoy a meetup, but if someone's expectations are not met because a discussion was too technical, it feels like a failing.
