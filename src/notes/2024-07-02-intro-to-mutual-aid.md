> Charity affirms the existing distribution of wealth and life chances. Mutual aid challenges it. Charity is top-down. Mutual aid is horizontal. Charity is about control, hierarchy, and isolation. Mutual aid is about solidarity, liberation, and participation.

I've been thinking more and more about [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYPgTZeF5Z0) gRegor shared earlier this year. Also, [his post about the mutual aid group](https://gregorlove.com/2024/03/weekly-roundup/) he volunteers with. I love their name and slogan: "[We All We Got](https://www.weallwegotsd.com/)".

Instead of falling into a cycle of despair and [doomscrolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomscrolling) when it comes to Supreme Court rulings and other events I can hardly control, I'd like to open my heart a bit more, get to know my neighbors and community, and [opt-in](/img/note-images/Opt-In-poster.jpg).

No judgement to anyone who feels the need to either doomscroll or avoid news altogether. When I find myself troubled, the one thing that helps me feel better is to orient myself towards action.
