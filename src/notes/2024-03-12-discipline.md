_Likes [Is Making Websites Hard, Or Do We Make It Hard? Or Is It Some of Both?](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2024/hard-websites/) by Jim Nielsen._

<blockquote>
<p>>In my experience, using default web mechanics to build websites — especially on behalf of _for-profit_ businesses — takes an incredible amount of discipline.</p>

<p>Self-discipline on behalf of the developer to not reach for a JavaScript re-implementation of a browser default.</p>

<p>But also organizational discipline on behalf of a business to say, “It’s ok if our implementation is ‘basic’ but functional.” (And being advocate for this approach, internally, can be tiring if not futile.)</p>
