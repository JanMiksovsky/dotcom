_Bookmarked [Figtree, an open-source geometric sans serif typeface](https://github.com/erikdkennedy/figtree) by Erik Kennedy._

This one feels a bit like the friendly, geometric cousin to [Inter by Rasmus Andersson](https://rsms.me/inter/). Like Inter, this is available on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Figtree) (with italics) and [Bunny Fonts](https://fonts.bunny.net/family/figtree) (without italics, for now).

There is a font similar (not identical) to this, called [Metropolis](https://fontsarena.com/metropolis-by-chris-simpson/), that Mozilla uses in their [style guide](https://protocol.mozilla.org/docs/fundamentals/typography.html). The designer, Chris Simpson [pulled it off GitHub in 2020](https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/metropolis-font-repo-missing/69415/3) after legal threat from one of the biggest names in typography.
