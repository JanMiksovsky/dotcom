_Bookmarked [Naming Variables In CSS](https://jwdallas.com/posts/namingcssvariables/) by Jonathan Dallas._

> _What follows is not gospel. CSS to me is a very poetic language, there are so many different ways to express the same concepts. I like these conventions but do not consider them the one correct way to name variables in CSS._

Some useful considerations in here, like **namespacing** to avoid collisions in multiple projects, and combining camelCasing with "kebab casing" to make variables easier to scan. Also, üëç to "value-based" and "usage-based" names. [I kind of learned this one practically](https://nicksimson.com/posts/2021-redesign-dark-mode/) when I started implementing 'light' and 'dark' themes in 2021.
