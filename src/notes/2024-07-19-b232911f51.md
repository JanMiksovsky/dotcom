_Likes [Send a Friend a Webmention Day](https://events.indieweb.org/2024/07/send-a-friend-a-webmention-day-Yg7gsfhZDigm) by IndieWeb Events._

July 30 is the [International Day of Friendship](https://www.un.org/en/observances/friendship-day), but folks in the indie web celebrate by sending their friends a [webmention](https://indieweb.org/Webmention).

With some troubleshooting help from [David](https://david.shanske.com/), you can now send a generic webmention to nicksimson.com, and it will show up (probably after some comment moderation) on my [Mentions](https://nicksimson.com/mentions/) page.

Please, keep it friendly.
