One year for my dad’s birthday I sent him a [pick punch](https://www.pickpunch.com/): a fun way to recycle old plastic cards into guitar picks.

I was unpacking some of my dad’s music stuff my mom sent me this week. So here’s Dad and I (age 16 first driver license photo) immortalized as guitar picks now.
