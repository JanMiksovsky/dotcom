> I can’t believe how good it feels to reconnect with this. As an artist, knowing that you’re capable of doing something yet not doing it for years—decades even—is painful. It feels like a waste. Of course, I’m doing other things, like making fonts, which is also creatively fulfilling. In fact, I’ve often wondered if getting so busy making fonts was the reason I wasn’t drawing as much. Apparently not.

I've been trying to get back in the habit of playing my guitar—I'm nowhere near as good at guitar as Mark is at caricature—and I can relate to this feeling. Music does feel more physical, tactile, and like I'm using a different part of my brain than UI stuff or web development.

Check out the drawings on [Mark's Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/marksimonson74/). In an alternate timeline he could have ended up illustrating for _Rolling Stone_ or something.
