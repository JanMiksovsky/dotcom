Oof. My sincere apologies to anyone subscribing via RSS or other means who has been flooded with posts from me this weekend. I've already heard from at least one of you.

I had to set up redirects from the old RSS feeds to the new ones, and changed DNS settings, and also made the www prefix my primary domain. Seventeen years of running this website, and you'd think I'd have learned some things by now.

I'm so sorry for messing up your experience.
