I had an unusual dream last night. There was Ken Burns branded apparel.

Specifically, shirts based on his various [documentary series for PBS](https://www.pbs.org/kenburns/films). 

Imagine wearing the American Civil War, or Baseball, or Jazz music in shirt form. [Tommy Bahama](https://www.tommybahama.com/) style shirts with graphic prints.

Anyway, there's a free merch idea, PBS.
