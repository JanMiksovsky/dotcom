> I’ve been working on content management and publishing systems for nearly three decades, both personally and professionally, and this feels like the right time to finally take what I’ve learned and direct it into a single awesome thing. [Neato](https://neato.pub/) will be a standalone service, but it’ll also be available as part of [Web 1 Land](https://web1.land) and [omg.lol](https://omg.lol) (where it will power just about everything from profile pages to statuslog entries). I am _really_ excited about it.

Does the world need another [blogging engine](https://manuelmoreale.com/blog-platforms)? _Absolutely_. It is awesome to watch Adam make the web fun again with [omg.lol](https://home.omg.lol/) and other fine products.
