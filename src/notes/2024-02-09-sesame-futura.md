_In reply to [Typography and Nick Simson’s 26 Days of Type](https://artlung.com/blog/2024/02/08/typography/) by Joe Crawford._

I appreciate the shout out from [Joe’s blog](https://artlung.com/) today! And I’d like to contribute toward the mystery of this Sesame Street alphabet...

This is clearly a modification of Paul Renner's [Futura typeface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futura_(typeface)). The uppercase **I** and numeral **4** are the giveaways that it is something different. My searches for "Sesame Street Futura" bring up some links to a digitization on [Deviantart](https://www.deviantart.com/sesamestreet1969/art/Sesame-Street-Futura-Free-Font-Download-996931424), and a promo for the same font on YouTube. There's some great lo-res [visual material in this PDF](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED086203.pdf), but no "official alphabet." I trawled eBay and have a saved search now for "Vintage Sesame Street Alphabet Magnet" to see if that original toy comes up.

I also have a book on loan from my local library, _[Never Use Futura](https://literal.club/book/never-use-futura-8j873)_ by Doug Thomas. It's all about the political and cultural history of this one typeface. If any _Sesame Street_ material pops up in that book, I'll be sure to share. The other thing I'm thinking of is that surely the Childrens' Television Workshop (now [Sesame Workshop](https://sesameworkshop.org/)) has an archivist. If this typeface exists anywhere, it'd be in the archives.
