The Website Carbon Calculator recently [updated its rating system](https://www.websitecarbon.com/introducing-the-website-carbon-rating-system/), and it has been a while since I tested my website. So let's see the results.

My home page, which is an index of the most recent 10 posts [scored a **B** today](https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/nicksimson-com/): "cleaner than about 66% of all web pages globally". My web hosting appears to be running on "sustainable energy" which sounds good...I don't have a ton of insight into how [Flywheel/WPEngine runs their data centers](https://getflywheel.com/why-flywheel/global-availability/), so there is a chance that the company offsets their emissions.

I wanted to test another page since there's an embedded YouTube video on my homepage today, so I tried the [All The Things](https://nicksimson.com/all/) page, which [scored an **A**](https://www.websitecarbon.com/website/nicksimson-com-all/) -- hooray! I suspect this is because there are fewer assets and requests happening on this particular page.

I'm sure there is much more I can do to optimize my website performance and reduce my website's carbon footprint. Maybe I can do some [digital xeriscaping](/notes/2024-03-11-xeriscaping.html) this year.
