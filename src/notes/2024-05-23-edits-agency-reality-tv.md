[Emily Nussbaum, writing about 'Love is Blind' in the _New Yorker_](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2024/05/27/is-love-is-blind-a-toxic-workplace):

> I kept thinking about those goblets with their thick gold coating, campy enough for a pirate movie. The cups popped up not only in the pods but at cast barbecues and during family visits, subbed in by a crew member for the household’s regular glassware. Like everything else on set, the goblets served a purpose: because you couldn’t tell how much booze was in them, an editor could cut a scene in any order—if the level went up or down, you couldn’t tell. That is the nature of all reality shows, however delightful they may be to watch: the power lies with those who design the experiment, who have thousands of hours of footage of cast members, often drunk or confessing to highly personal stories, which the company owns and is allowed to air or not air, at any time it likes, and in any order. The cast members have some choices of their own: they can play up to the producers, resist them, or try to work around them. Like gamblers in Vegas, everyone has a system. But the house always wins.
