> I also think the oft bandied about trope that: to disengage with social media is to retreat to some bourgeoisie bubble of privileged la-la-la-I’m-not-listening, is not only nonsense, but a dangerous framing. **In fact, the main beneficiaries of staying with your eyes glued to the Doom Stream are the companies producing the streams.** That’s why they’re so seductive. (Not because the streams are righteous, but because the streams are super duper profitable; the paperclip machine will make paperclips at all costs, will enchant you into the Church of Paperclip.) The greatest trick modern internet giants played on us was making us believe that political engagement — to be an ally, as it were — _requires_ sacrificing our own health (physical and mental). When, in fact, the most capable (and, paradoxically, tuned into the world) and tangibly influential folk I know are those disengaged from that dopamine-cortisol loop.
