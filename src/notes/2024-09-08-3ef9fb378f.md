_Bookmarked [El Paso Sector Migrant Death Database](https://www.elpasomigrantdeathdatabase.org/)._

> The migrant death database published here is an attempt to address the lack of comprehensive, transparent, and publicly available migrant death data for New Mexico, El Paso and border-wide. The accessibility of this information is essential to understanding and preventing death and disappearance in the US/Mexico borderlands.

Learned about this latest resource from the summer newsletter published by [No More Deaths/No MÃ¡s Muertes](https://nomoredeaths.org/en/), a humanitarian organization based in Arizona.
