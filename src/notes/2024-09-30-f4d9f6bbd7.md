The New York Mets have secured their spot in the postseason in [the first game of a postponed double-header](https://www.mlb.com/mets/news/mets-clinch-2024-playoff-berth-with-win-over-braves) against the Atlanta Braves. That eighth inning was incredible. A fitting ending to a season of incredible ups and downs, and I kind of expect Howie Rose to blow out his voice during Game 2.
