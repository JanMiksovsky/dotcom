[Jason, on his good-enough coffee method](https://www.fromjason.xyz/p/notebook/the-bliss-of-good-enough-an-ode-to-my-moka-pot/):

<blockquote>
<p>My moka pot doesn't have a companion app for me to log my coffee consumption habits (thank goodness). It doesn't require DRM coffee pods, or a monthly coffee subscription. It doesn't email me about the latest moka pot models; I don't even know who makes it. All my moka pot does is push water from one chamber to the other when heat is applied, and if coffee grounds happen to be packed inside, it then turns that water into a piping hot cup of joe.</p>

<p>My moka pot is the product of some Italian guy's imagination, and not a board room of venture capitalists who wear sweater vests and talk about “cornering the market.” And because of that fact, my moka pot's design is timeless. Long after all the “Internet of Things” coffee makers are rotting away in some landfill (or under the rubble of a lost civilization) the humble moka pot will be there, ready to make someone a good-enough cup of coffee.</p>
