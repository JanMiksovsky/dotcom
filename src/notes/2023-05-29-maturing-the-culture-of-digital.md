_Likes [Maturing the Culture of Digital](https://mindfulweb.substack.com/p/maturing-the-culture-of-digital) by Lisa Welchman._

> We’ve created a way of working where the digital maker community (including its leaders) is addicted to speed in design and deployment but largely averse to, and largely ill-equipped to deal with the consequences of this pace. Where we are is a natural right-on-time symptom of the adolescent phase of our industry. And it’s time to grow up.
