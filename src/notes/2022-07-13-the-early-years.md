We’ve been hosting family visits for several weeks this summer, most recently with my wife’s sister and her family. The visit is winding down, and tonight my five year old nephew said “Wait, you have a CD player?” He meant my turntable and vinyl collection, and I told both kids we could play a record after they finished brushing their teeth. I started holding up sleeves, and the kids chose the most colorful cover, which was [The Drifters - Their Greatest Recordings, The Early Years](https://www.discogs.com/master/513925-The-Drifters-Their-Greatest-RecordingsEarly-Years). 🎶 🎵

Of all the discs in my record collection, I was a bit surprised my niece and nephew wanted to hear a R&B group formed nearly 70 years ago, but they loved it and were dancing around the living room.
