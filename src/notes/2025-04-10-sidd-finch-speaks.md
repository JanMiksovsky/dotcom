Since I posted about [George Plimpton's Sidd Finch hoax](/notes/2025-04-04-sidd-finch.html) last week, the New York Mets were able to bring [the real Sidd Finch](https://nypost.com/2025/04/08/sports/legendary-sidd-finch-finally-makes-it-to-mets-home-game-40-years-later/) (OK, the Illinois school teacher who portrayed him in the photos for the magazine story) to Citi Field for the first&nbsp;time.

Longtime Mets PR director/historian [Jay Horwitz sat down with Joe Berton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDwDrzuV_4Y) to re-live the role they both played in pulling off this elaborate April Fool's Day joke 40 years&nbsp;ago.
