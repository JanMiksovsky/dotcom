When you work remote, on a big team of mostly remote workers, the time you are able to be together in-person is so valuable. This week I was able to spend two full days in in-person meetings at our Washington, DC office. It's been some time (December 2023) since I was last in DC with the team. Without going into too much detail, we've gone through a lot since then.

There were enough breaks plus some official unstructured events for some quality time with my colleagues. I didn't have a chance to chat with **everyone**, but I did make an effort to connect with some newer faces and folks I usually don't interact with every week. So glad I did, even if it was just talking about post punk records or how not to throw a three year old's birthday party. Efforts are made, but we don't quite have the "virtual water cooler" environment for this kind of bonding. So that makes this rare, infrequent time together all the more meaningful. I returned home with a positive outlook and warm feelings toward this great group of humans I work with.
