I was reminded that every YouTube channel has a built-in RSS feed, and so I have slowly started to add a few of my subscribed channels to my feed reader, NetNewsWire. Right now these include NPR Music (tiny desk concerts) and KEXP (in studio performances).

I can't watch the embedded video in NetNewsWire; I have to click on the title to get sent to YouTube. And I'm not sure how to bring in the descriptions, either...I can totally read the [KEXP XML file](https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC3I2GFN_F8WudD_2jUZbojA), for example. And this is a [new feature request](https://github.com/Ranchero-Software/NetNewsWire/issues/4065) in GitHub issues, too. Already this feels like a calmer way to consume video.

This is the YouTube home screen I prefer: no notifications, no dumb algorithmic suggestions. Just a big 'ol search box.
