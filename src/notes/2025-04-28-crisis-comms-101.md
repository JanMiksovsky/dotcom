> Drama is the sworn enemy of the Privileged Guy in Tech, for it disrupts the relative peace and tranquility that one enjoys with the privileged life. “Drama” is also the pejorative label that Privileged Guys in Tech apply to actual issues that warrant proper handling, because it’s a convenient way to minimize those issues and avoid responsibility (two critical survival skills for the Privileged Guys in Tech)...

> ...If you don’t know what to say, then just say this: “Thanks for bringing this to my attention. This is a very serious concern, and it deserves to be treated seriously. I’m going to look into this, and I will respond soon.” There, was that so hard? You didn’t admit to anything, and you didn’t have to sell your soul to the woke mob. You offered confirmation that the concern was heard and that you’re going to examine it further. And by doing that, you’ve already made people feel better.

The whole post is **excellent**, which is why I include _two_ excerpts here. I sincerely hope more people take the time to read the whole thing.
