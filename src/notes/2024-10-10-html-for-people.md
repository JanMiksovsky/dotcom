_Bookmarked [HTML for People](https://htmlforpeople.com/) by Blake Watson._

> I feel strongly that anyone should be able to make a website with HTML if they want. This book will teach you how to do just that. It doesn’t require any previous experience making websites or coding. I will cover everything you need to know to get started in an approachable and friendly way.

This little web book came out today, and it looks amazing. I’m going to send to all my pals asking how they can make a website. ❤️
