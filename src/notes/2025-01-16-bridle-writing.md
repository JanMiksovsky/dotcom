James Bridle, [Why I Write](https://www.frieze.com/article/why-i-write-0):

> Itâ€™s a misconception about the isolation of art, and the hermeticism of writing. Writing, more visibly and unquestionably today than ever, is inherently networked. It begins and remains connected to its subject, and to everything else, becoming part of it. It acts. It does work. It lives. When we write, we reconfigure the world.
