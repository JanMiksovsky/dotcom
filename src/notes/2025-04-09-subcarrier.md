<p>In the years following a global pandemic and becoming a dad, I miss going to rock shows. Not that I went to that many before my mid-thirties. Browsing PBS.org, I recently stumbled on <i>Subcarrier</i>, a live music show recorded from Birmingham, AL. In 8 seasons, they've featured some of my new favorites, like <a href="https://www.pbs.org/video/metz-uawvfz/">METZ</a>, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/video/wand-56cvss/">Wand</a>, and <a href="https://www.pbs.org/video/horsegirl-moholx/">Horsegirl</a>.</p>
