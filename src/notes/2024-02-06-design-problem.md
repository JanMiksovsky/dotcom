> By many measures, design has become a caricature of itself. Being gatekeepers while preaching inclusion, equality, and empathy. Making fun of Comic Sans because it is perceived as ugly but can actually possibly be helpful for people with dyslexia is anti-design. Being snobby about visual design so that other people feel it’s not their place to have an opinion because they don’t know all the terminology is anti-design. Telling people they must use Figma to be taken seriously is anti-design.
