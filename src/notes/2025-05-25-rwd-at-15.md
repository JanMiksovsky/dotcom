Ethan Marcotte's [Responsive Web Design article](https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/) was published 15 years ago this day in the web magazine _A List Apart_. [Phil Archer has a few words on his website](https://philarcher.org/diary/2025/responsive-web-design/) about this contribution, and how it changed the way websites were made. [Ethan's also written a few words](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/responsive-design-at-15/) on his own site today.

At the time, I was working for the U.S. Census Bureau, knocking on doors in Knoxville, Tennessee. I didn't read Ethan's article until a year later, when I was hired as a designer at the University of Tennessee. It was a thrilling time to be getting my feet wet as a young designer and seeing everyone figure this thing out early on. I remember all the experiments, the user research, the arguments(!), the redesigns big and small. Its incredible to see how the web designer's mindset, tools, and the CSS language itself has advanced since then.
