I've been thinking about [this post by Todd Libby](https://toddl.dev/posts/the-decision-to-leave-tech/) for a couple days now. ðŸ’” I refuse to believe there is such thing as a "tech community." There is a "tech industry," however, and it has chewed up and spat out countless talented people.

I hope the next thing you find is fulfilling, Todd. And know this: you motivated and inspired a lot of people (including me) who will keep fighting the good fight.
