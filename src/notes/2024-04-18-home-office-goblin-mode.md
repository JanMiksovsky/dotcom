I'm in [goblin mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goblin_mode), at least when it comes to my home office.

Rather than find a replacement for my busted office chair, I attached a bright green bungee cord to the base of the armrests around the back. It kind of works.

The guitars are in the closet for now, since I needed room to sleep on the floor while my sister was visiting last weekend.

I have un-hung artwork, various small electronics, boxes of books and records against the walls. There's potty-training equipment that will hopefully be used this summer, but guess which room is the staging area?

I'm too embarrassed to share a photo of my setup right now, but here's Steve Jobs in his home office in 2004, if you're looking for an approximation:

Thank goodness for background blur mode in Zoom and Microsoft Teams.
