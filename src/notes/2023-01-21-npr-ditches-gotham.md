Visited [npr.org](https://www.npr.org/) today and discovered [Gotham](https://www.typography.com/fonts/gotham/overview) (Hoefler&Co./Monotype) was swapped out for [Lato](https://github.com/latofonts/lato-source) (open source) recently.

Iâ€™m probably among the 0.5% to notice the typographic change, but yes, it threw me off.
