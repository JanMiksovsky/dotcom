<p><a href="https://jan.miksovsky.com/">Jan</a> reached out to me a while ago about using my site and source code, specifically my <a href="/library.html">library page</a> as an example for a post he was working on. I saw an earlier draft of this article, and it was delightful to see this published (with a screenshot of my little site) in a magazine named <a href="https://goodinternetmagazine.com/"><i>Good Internet</i></a>.</p>
