On the subject of "[Sesame Futura](https://nicksimson.com/notes/sesame-futura/)", I found some [delightful production images](https://willkrause.com/letters-and-numbers-for-sesame-street/) from 2009 on Will Krause's blog.

> I’m working in the Art Department of _Sesame Street_, and I made plenty of letters and numbers for the 41st season. Most were made out of foamcore or blue foam, but I did make some “7’s” that I scored so that they would break apart easily when Cookie Monster chomped on them.
