> This morning—before those nineteen games, the instant I woke up—I realized that the letters in _CAUTIONED_ can be rearranged to spell _EDUCATION_. This seemed vastly better than waking up with no memory of the previous night, worried about what I may have done or said. Nonetheless, the thinking is obsessive and constant. The unwilling, unconscious anagramming of words is the primary side effect of a life devoted to Scrabble. This is ultimately what the game is about: memorizing words with no concern for their meaning.
