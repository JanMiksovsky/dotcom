I've been streaming [Cardinals At The Window](https://cardinalsatthewindow.bandcamp.com/album/cardinals-at-the-window-2), a massive collection of 136 tracks by various artists to benefit recovery efforts in Western North Carolina after hurricane Helene.

> 100% of proceeds to Helene relief and recovery in Western NC. Current recipients of funds are Community Foundation of Western North Carolina, Mutual Aid Disaster Relief, Rural Organizing and Resilience (via Holler Harm Reduction), and Poder Emma (via Colaborativa la Milpa)

I love a musical grab-bag, and this one's for a good cause. Pick it up on Bandcamp for $10, but of course you can give more.
