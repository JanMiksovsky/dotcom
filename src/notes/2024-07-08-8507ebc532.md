> In my opinion, the only reason that accessibility overlay vendors have been successful is because they primarily market to website owners. They’re marketing to an audience that mostly doesn’t use their product, and doesn’t have the necessary expertise to judge whether or not it works. If they were selling to people with disabilities, their products would actually have to work.
