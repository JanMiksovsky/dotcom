> When I first started, I thought I’d be a Michelin-starred chef in web design. Every project would be a painstakingly crafted meal of delectables for which patrons would always be happy to pay premium.

> I’ve learned that I am indeed a chef, but there’s a range of meals I’d be cooking. A select handful have been tasting menus of the highest-level ingredients. I’m lucky to have been able to participate in those, and I hope a few more come my way in the next few decades of my career. A few meals have also been fast food: done, delivered, and gone before you could blink. Most meals, though, have been simple and tasty home-cooked dinners. Nothing to write a newspaper review about, but most of my guests were full and happy.
