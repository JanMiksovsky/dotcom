_Bookmarked [Theme Machine](https://tools.keithjgrant.com/theme-machine/wheel/) by Keith J. Grant._

The Theme Machine is two tools in one: a color picker and palette generator. You can build custom color palettes in the browser, then export them as CSS custom properties. Keith has a helpful [blog post describing the tool](https://keithjgrant.com/posts/2024/06/theme-machine-a-css-color-palette-tool/) he built.
