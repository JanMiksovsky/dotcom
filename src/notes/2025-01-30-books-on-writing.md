[Bookworks](https://www.bkwrks.com/), a local store here in Albuquerque places their staff picks all over the bookshelves inside. You can also pick up a bookmark featuring a staff member’s top ten picks for a particular genre. I was intrigued by Deb’s ten essential books on writing, recognizing many of the authors and a few of the titles here.
