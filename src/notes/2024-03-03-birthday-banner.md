My daughter (2), niece (9) and father in-law (70) all celebrate birthdays the same week in March. We’ll be having one big family celebration for all three.

My wife modified this LOL doll banner (the 9 year old’s favorite) with images of Baby Shark (the 2 year old’s favorite) plus Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Søren Kierkegaard (the 70 year old’s favorites).
