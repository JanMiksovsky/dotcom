_Bookmarked [Fontshare: Quality Fonts. Free.](https://www.fontshare.com/)._

Last week I wrote about [switching from Google Fonts to self-hosting my webfonts](https://nicksimson.com/posts/2022-these-webfonts-do-not-track-you/). Self-hosting variable fonts is not that difficult, but finding the variable font files from Google can be tricky.

If you are interested in switching from variable fonts on Google's CDN to self-hosting, Fontshare is worth looking into. They don't have every Google variable font, but many of the better-designed ones. My current choices, [Literata](https://www.fontshare.com/fonts/literata/) and [Epilogue](https://www.fontshare.com/fonts/epilogue) are both on Fontshare.

In addition to many open source designs, ITF offer their own "closed source" designs, which are still free to download and use, even for commercial projects. I'm particularly drawn to [Satoshi](https://www.fontshare.com/fonts/satoshi), [Zodiak](https://www.fontshare.com/fonts/zodiak), and [General Sans](https://www.fontshare.com/fonts/general-sans).
