This morning I made sure to download Canela, Domaine Display, Founders Grotesk, and Graphik; some of the [nice type shipped with MacOS](https://support.apple.com/en-md/HT212587).

I do wish Apple made these fonts available by default on MacOS, iOS, and Safari (like Iowan Old Style and Avenir). They can give documents and presentations _oomph_.
