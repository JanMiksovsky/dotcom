Morning ascent in Albuquerque, NM.

We got up early and headed to North Domingo Baca Park, binoculars in hand. This is my first time being in town for the International Balloon Fiesta. I saw the photos from family members who were much closer to the action. Definitely want to do this when our kid is a bit older.
