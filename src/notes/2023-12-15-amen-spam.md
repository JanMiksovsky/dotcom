Ryan Broderick, writing in his [**Garbage Day** newsletter](https://www.garbageday.email/p/the-amen-spam-conquered-facebook):

> There’s some poetry here. Facebook was an extinction level event for blogging long before it ate the rest of the web. Also, the platform’s size and scale, you [could argue](https://www.ft.com/content/35bc6a04-0450-359b-b6bd-ce5bd1cfe245), rivals the Vatican. And now the social network that has defined culture, swung elections, and reshaped the way we communicate has degraded to such a state that it’s been conquered by one guy blogging about Catholicism who may or may not be aware he’s even done it.
