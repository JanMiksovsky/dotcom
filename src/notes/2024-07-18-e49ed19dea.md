A presentation by [Steve Ryan](https://sryan.us/) today reminded me that Custom Post Types were introduced in [WordPress version 3.0](https://wordpress.org/news/2010/06/thelonious/) (June 2010). That was around the time I started using WordPress professionally.

What a release that was:

- Custom post types

- Custom taxonomies

- Multi-site functionality

- [Appearance menus](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/appearance-menus-screen/)

- [Twenty Ten default theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentyten/)

I'm sure there were colleges and universities running WordPress before this release, but those first three things are what made it viable to finally consider [WordPress as a CMS for higher education](https://wpcampus.org/).
