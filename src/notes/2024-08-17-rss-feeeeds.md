I'm slowly moving the YouTube channels I'm subscribed to into [feeeed](https://feeeed.nateparrott.com/), a clever RSS app by Nate Parrott.

I still love me some [Net News Wire](https://netnewswire.com/), but I think feeeed handles the multimedia content a little bit better. So if you're keeping score, that's two RSS readers I'm currently using... three if you include [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/) for podcasts.
