[The Ordinary Things](https://theordinarythings.com) have a new album out this weekend! It's called "IV."

I just updated their website, but you can listen to it on [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/iv/1759902825) and [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/41KH3qwfnbo7RDEaPNuWvN?si=ao6_7ULJQIKP6QXWwbul0Q), and hopefully the other places where you buy/stream music?
