The 99% Invisible podcast is doing a yearlong book club for Robert A. Caro's The _Power Broker_. The [first episode in the series](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/power-broker-01-robert-caro/), on the Introduction and first 100 or so pages came out a couple days ago, and features Mr. Caro himself as a guest.

[Another episode from December](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/breaking-down-the-power-broker/) features self-proclaimed Caro fanboy Conan O'Brien and is an overview of the book, answering the question _why should I read this 1,200 page book about expressways and parks and bridges_?

Itâ€™s not too late to join in the fun...there's even a Discord server! I finished this book a few years ago (and am not sure if I'm ready to re-read it just yet). I'm totally going along for the ride and tuning in to this series all year long.
