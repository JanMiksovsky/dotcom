> The reason why I don’t write about dev stuff it’s because, like many others, I suffer from [impostor syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome). I’ve been working on the web for more than 12 years. I’m still convinced I don’t know shit.

I can relate. My dev posts are few and far between. Now that I've been doing more UI stuff in the last two years, I'm spending more time in Sketch and Figma (and even Webflow) than VSCode these days. Still love reading about [CSS](/tags/css), [web components](/tags/web-components/), [accessibility](/tags/accessibility/) -- all the frontend stuff.
