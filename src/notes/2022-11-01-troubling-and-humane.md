The New York Times: [The Troubling and Humane Photography of Baldwin Lee](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/31/opinion/baldwin-lee-photography-black-america.html)

> On every possible level, this is an extraordinary body of work: moving, illuminating, troubling, above all humane. Mr. Lee did not frame his photographs to appall, although any minimally empathetic person will be appalled by the conditions they often capture. He framed them in a way that most often features, within the surroundings of brutal poverty, human beings whose expression, gesture or stance insists on their own profound dignity. On a self that is irreducible and irreplaceable.
