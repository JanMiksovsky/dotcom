_Bookmarked [The Negative Impact of Mobile-First Web Design on Desktop](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/content-dispersion/)._

Try not to be alarmed by the headline. They key phrase here is **content dispersion**, an effect of scaling up the mobile experience, increasing cognitive load and interaction costs.

It sounds a bit counterintuitive, but the user research and proposed alternative patterns are worth looking at.
