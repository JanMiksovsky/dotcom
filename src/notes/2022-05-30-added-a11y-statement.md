I spent a little time this weekend adding an [accessibility statement](https://nicksimson.com/accessibility/) to my personal website. This is important to me for a few reasons.

- I tried to make all the features and content on my site as accessible as I know how to do. I want my users to know I care about them.
    
- I want people who work with me to understand the importance of digital accessibility and my commitment to ongoing learning and social responsibility.
    
- If there are errors or accessibility issues on my site, I need to know about them so I can go about fixing them as quickly as possible.
    
It’s far more common to see accessibility statements where they may be legally required, such as large corporations, governments, and education websites. I have noticed a few people I look up to include statements on their sites, and I’ve linked to them on my own page.
