WordPress's block editor, or "Gutenberg" has come a long way since December 2018, when it officially arrived in the WP 5.0 release.

I know many people still hate it, and it took close to five years for me to really get comfortable with it. That said, I still have plenty of WYSIWTF moments with the editor, particularly the Query Loop block.
