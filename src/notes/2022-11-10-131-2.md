Yesterday was the one year anniversary of [my father’s unexpected death](https://nicksimson.com/posts/2021-boone/).

I don’t have dreams about my father often, but last night I dreamed the two of us were at a guitar shop together, trying out different instruments and playing songs.

Music was one of the many things we shared. I miss you, Dad.
