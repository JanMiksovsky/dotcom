I wrote myself a note intending to post a link to this on April 1. A classic April Fool's joke turned 40 this week. In 1985, George Plimpton famously published "[The Curious Case Of Sidd Finch](https://www.si.com/mlb/2014/10/15/curious-case-sidd-finch)" in <i>Sports Illustrated</i>, about a mysterious rookie pitcher with a 168 mile an hour fastball.

There's also [a delightful video about this hoax](https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/george-plimpton-web-exclusive-plimpton-plays-april-fools-in-sport-illustrated/2947/) from PBS.
