_Likes [Pluralistic: Vice surrenders (24 Feb 2024)](https://pluralistic.net/2024/02/24/anti-posse/#when-you-absolutely-positively-dont-give-a-solitary-single-fuck) by Cory Doctorow._

> True to form, those private equity scumbags locked all those workers out of the company's CMS without notice – and then forgot to lock down the podcasting back-end. That allowed a group of Vice veterans – Matthew Gault, Emily Lipstein, Anna Merlan, Tim Marchman and Mack Lamoureux – to gather for a totally unauthorized, tell-all session that they pushed out on an official Vice channel.

I saved the [podcast audio to my Huffduffer profile](https://huffduffer.com/nsmsn/688145) (and may upload to the Internet Archive for posterity) in case Vice Media takes it down from YouTube or shuts down the feed, etc. It's worth a listen.
