Today I discovered [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) has a bunch of fun "pro" icons in its current set, including this one based on [Geordi La Forge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geordi_La_Forge) from _Star Trek_:

[![abstract icon of a person in a starfleet command uniform and visor](/img/note-images/Screenshot-2024-03-19-at-2.44.45-PM-1024x586.png)](https://fontawesome.com/icons/user-visor?f=classic&s=duotone)

Even better, I also discovered [levarburton.com](https://levarburton.com/) uses this icon plus others from the set.
