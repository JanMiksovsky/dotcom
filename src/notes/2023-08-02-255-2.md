> The web would be a much better place if fullstack, framework-focused developers used Learn HTML to better understand the basics, but we all can learn something from the course.

In case you missed it, check out [Hot HTML Summer](https://danabyerly.com/tag/hot-html-summer/), Dana Byerly's blog series on the web.dev [Learn HTML course](https://web.dev/learn/html/).

I've already learned a ton just by following Dana's posts. I look forward to taking the course myself.
