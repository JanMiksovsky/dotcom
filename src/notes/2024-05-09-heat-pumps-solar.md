I found this [WIRED story about heat pumps](https://www.wired.com/story/heat-pump-worker-shortage/) pretty fascinating:

> If billionaires actually cared about saving the planet, they’d pool their vast wealth and buy everyone a [heat pump](https://www.wired.com/story/why-you-the-planet-need-heat-pump/). Instead of burning planet-warming fossil fuels, these appliances extract warmth from even freezing outdoor air and transfer it into a building, thanks to [neat tricks of physics](https://www.wired.com/story/how-do-heat-pumps-work/). In the summer, they reverse to act like an air-conditioning unit. One [recent study](https://www.wired.com/story/what-would-happen-if-every-american-got-a-heat-pump/) found that if everyone in the United States got a heat pump, it’d slash emissions in the building sector by 36 to 64 percent, and cut overall national emissions by 5 to 9 percent. (Because they’re fully electric, heat pumps run on a grid increasingly loaded with renewable energy.)

I have an ancient gas furnace that still works, but is pretty noisy when we start running it in October. It would make sense to replace it with a heat pump. The gist of the WIRED piece, though, is that there are currently not enough HVAC technicians properly trained in the new heat pump technology, so finding the right person to consult, install, and service the thing is critical.

If we go with a heat pump, then it probably makes more sense to switch our electricity to rooftop solar. There's an [employee-owned solar company](https://www.positiveenergysolar.com/) here in Albuquerque I've heard great things about. Most of our days are sunny here in the Southwest. And water-wise, I would like to [xeriscape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xeriscaping) everything in the front and back yard. I'm looking into what makes the most sense for us (and the planet) in the long term.
