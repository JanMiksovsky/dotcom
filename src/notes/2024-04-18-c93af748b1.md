_Bookmarked [No Web Without Women](https://nowebwithoutwomen.com) by Selman Design._

> A collection of innovations by women in the fields of computer science and technology.

Love the type (Base 9 and Base 12 by [Zuzana Licko](https://www.emigre.com/Designer/ZuzanaLicko)) and colors on this site. Almost a digital "zine" feel. Link via [Linda Thompson](https://www.lindakat.com/).
