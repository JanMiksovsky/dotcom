[Reimagining the Internet](https://publicinfrastructure.org/podcasts/reimagining-the-internet/) is a podcast from the [Initiative for Digital Public Infrastructure at UMass Amherst](https://publicinfrastructure.org). I stumbled across it this weekend and have listened to three interviews so far:

- [Charles Broskoski on the social research platform Are.na](https://publicinfrastructure.org/podcast/105-arena-good-web/)

- [Laurel Schwulst on the "PBS of the Internet"](https://publicinfrastructure.org/podcast/107-laurel-schwulst-good-web/)

- [Jessamyn West on taking ownership over MetaFilter, a 25 year old community weblog and forum.](https://publicinfrastructure.org/podcast/104-good-web-metafilter/)
