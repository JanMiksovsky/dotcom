_Likes [My grandpa was a Nazi](https://bastianallgeier.com/notes/grandpa) by Bastian Allgeier._

> I learned that the older members in my family had an invisible bond that protected men like him. He also wasn't visible as a Nazi to the rest of the world. He would mostly keep his stories for me or sometimes certain sentences would drop during family gatherings. I learned how the generation of my parents tried to get away from all that but deeply struggled.
