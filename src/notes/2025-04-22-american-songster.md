Bandcamp Daily: [How Dom Flemons Is Preserving American Music History, One Song at a Time](https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/dom-flemons-carolina-chocolate-drops-interview)

> A century after the emergence of the traveling “songster”—a term used to describe someone who sings and plays a variety of music—in American popular culture, Flemons is reviving the singing troubadour tradition for a 21st century audience. He has a near-encyclopedic knowledge of American vernacular music, able to rattle off riveting folk music histories at a moment’s notice, on stage and off. Flemons’s use of the term “songster” is a way for him to pay homage both to the many Black musicians who claimed it throughout history, as well as to the myriad folk traditions Flemons is keeping alive through his stage act. Flemons’s demeanor is so mellow that it would be easy to underestimate him, if not for the sheer volume of folk history he keeps at his fingertips, something that’s helped him become one of the foremost advocates for the preservation and appreciation of Black and folk music traditions.
