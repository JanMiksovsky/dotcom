Today I started compiling a [list of kid-tested picture books](https://bookshop.org/lists/kid-tested-picture-books) on Bookshop.org.

O.C. is nearing two, and it's an age where she is making her preferences known. These are some of the books we find ourselves pulling off the shelf or checking out from the library frequently.

I'll add to the list as we discover more favorites.
