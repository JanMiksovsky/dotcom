Registered for [PWA Summit](https://pwasummit.org/), happening in October this year.

> A free, online, single-track conference focused on helping everyone succeed with Progressive Web Apps.

[Progressive Web Apps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps) (PWA) are something I have been meaning to explore more for years, since I first heard about them. In the meantime, [talks from last year](https://2021.pwasummit.org/) are still available online.
