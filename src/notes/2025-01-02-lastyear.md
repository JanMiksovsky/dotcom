As promised, my Last.Year Report (for music I scrobbled to Last.fm in 2024) is complete. I am a late adopter to Last.fm, and 2024 is my first full year of listening data.

Top artists:

1. Yo La Tengo
2. Guided By Voices
3. Califone
4. Hermanos Gutiérrez
5. Ghost*

Yo La Tengo continues to be a comfort blanket for me throughout the year. Two of their releases are in my top albums, and all five top tracks are YLT favorites.

My top hour for scrobbling: 10pm. I have this habit of hitting “shuffle” on my Apple Music Library as I fall asleep.

My all-time stats for Last.fm are collected on the website [lastfmstats.com](https://lastfmstats.com/user/nsmsn/dataset)
