_Likes [Withdrawing my workshop from HighEdWeb 2023](https://rachelcherry.me/posts/withdrawing-from-highedweb-2023) by Rachel Cherry._

At least two presenters are withdrawing from this year's HighEdWeb annual conference (which begins Sunday). One of the conference sponsors, Pantheon, provides web hosting for Alliance Defending Freedom, a hard-right legal advocacy group that [works to expand Christian practices within public schools and in government, outlaw abortion, and curtail the rights of LGBTQ people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliance_Defending_Freedom).

I won't link to the ADF website, but will link to a recent article in the _New Yorker_: [The Next Targets for the Group that Overturned Roe](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/10/09/alliance-defending-freedoms-legal-crusade). I encourage you to read this article, as well as everything in [Rachel's post](https://rachelcherry.me/posts/withdrawing-from-highedweb-2023#pantheon) under the heading **Why Pantheon's policies are harmful**.  

The [decision by the HighEdWeb board](https://link.highedweb.org/2023/10/on-values-sponsor-guidelines-and-open-communication/) to keep Pantheon on as a sponsor is disappointing. I support freedom of speech and freedom of religion, but what we have with the ADF is an organization committed to taking away the legal rights of others (with a Supreme Court majority willing to play along). There must be a ton of money involved: The ADF is paying a lot to host their stuff on Pantheon, and it costs a lot to put on a conference like HighEdWeb. The HighEdWeb board, like [other organizations](https://www.drupalnyc.org/news/questions-pantheon), has been aware of Pantheon's involvement with the ADF since April, and [much smaller conferences successfully terminated their agreements](https://www.wpcampus.org/blog/2023/06/wpcampus-announces-termination-of-partnership-with-pantheon/) with the company with far less time to reconfigure.

It has been several years since I attended a HighEdWeb event, and Iâ€™m not currently a member of this organizationI'm still in their Slack channel, and read their content from time to time.. My personal experience with HighEdWeb was positive: attending the annual conference was valuable for my professional development, early in my career. It was always an impressive event driven by passionate volunteers. If I were headed to Buffalo next week, I would definitely be boycotting the Pantheon sponsor session. If any organization I worked with was paying for Pantheon's services, I would be doing everything with my ability and influence to persuade them to find another web host.

This is a bit of a wake-up call for me to look carefully at the policies and behavior by companies providing technology and services I'm using personally and professionally. The actions (or inaction) of any sponsor or organization would likely influence my decision to attend sponsored events like HighEdWeb in the future. **Some things are just more important on principle**, and I support the decisions by [Reed](https://reedcodes.com/), [Rachel](https://rachelcherry.me/), and any others who are withdrawing from the conference program.
