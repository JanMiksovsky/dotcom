> For a web practitioner who cares about the craft, using a website these days can feel like a death by a thousand cuts. The most horrifying of all to me, is that the average user, even those with a strong sense of ethics and justice, doesn't even know what a good, ethical website is anymore. Being coerced into handing over your money/data and having your personal information tracked and sold is now par for the course.
