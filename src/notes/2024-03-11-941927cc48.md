I’m a bit puzzled why my profile image doesn’t always show up when I leave a comment on another website. I’ve noticed this a lot lately with other WordPress sites…I have a WP site, plus a [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com/nicksimsondotcom), and a microformats (IndieWeb) h-card as well. Am I missing something?
