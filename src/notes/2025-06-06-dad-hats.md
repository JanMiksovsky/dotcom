This morning I came across Rachel Kwon's poignant web page dedicated to [her dad's hat collection](https://kwon.nyc/dad-hats/).

> My dad has a pretty extensive collection of hats. A couple years ago he had an acute health event where he had to be hospitalized for weeks, so I went to visit home and help my mom. It was scary and sad. One afternoon at the house I was alone between hospital visits and looking for something to occupy time and brainspace and found many of his hats scattered in various places around the house, mostly closets.

I browsed this collection of images with some recognition. I lost my dad four years ago, and remember going through his stuff with my mom. I didn't keep any hats, but I do have his "pickleball shoes"&mdash;a pair of bright salmon colored Converse One Star sneakers.

I'm glad to read Rachel's dad is doing OK now. All the older men in my life had collections of hats, similar to this. I'm approaching 40, and I have quite a few myself. Thinking about what the various colors say about me; and what embroidered logos and graphics say about my own interests and hobbies; and what my collection of stuff will mean someday to the people I leave behind.
