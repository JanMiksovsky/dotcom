If you end up visiting the [Four Corners region](https://fourcornersgeotourism.com/map), there's lots to do. I would put [Chaco Culture National Historical Park](https://fourcornersgeotourism.com/entries/chaco-culture-national-historical-park/0c929d71-7a23-4b3c-ade7-c5fb259b51ce) and [Mesa Verde](https://fourcornersgeotourism.com/entries/mesa-verde-national-park/46818055-046c-4be6-b9a0-c7fedc9af548) on the top of the list. And yes, there is a spot where you can stand in four states at once!
