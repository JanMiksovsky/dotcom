_Bookmarked [How to prep, pack and transport vinyl records the right way (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDqLvQ1saG0)._

I’ll be moving house soon, and crossing the Mississippi River for the third time in my life. Last time I didn’t have as many records and didn’t pack them this carefully. I got lucky that time I guess. Gonna be a lot more careful with my collection this time around.
