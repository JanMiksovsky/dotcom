_In reply to [Woodie Guthrie - American](https://linkage.lol/woodie-guthrie-american/)._

This Woody Guthrie biography is on my books-to-acquire-and-read list...hopefully by the end of this year!

A few years ago I read _[Searching for Woody Guthrie](https://bookshop.org/a/21729/9781621905332)_ by Ron Briley, published by the university press where I used to work. That one was OK, but I'm eager to get my hands on a copy of the biography by Joe Klein.
