Adam Newbold, [Seizing the means of discovery](https://notes.neatnik.net/2025/05/seizing-the-means-of-discovery):

> The early web directories were born out of necessity, because alternatives (search engines) didn’t exist yet. Today, the alternatives often leave us disappointed. There’s an interesting irony in the idea that web directories could maybe serve as an alternative to the alternative, not just bringing us full circle, but maybe bringing us back to where we should have stayed all along.

It was fun to see [url.town](https://url.town/), an old-school web directory (remember those?) taking shape over the long weekend. There's a couple hundred entries so far, plus search and RSS. There are even profile pages for curators now... [here's mine](https://url.town/@nsmsn). Can't wait to discover more great links.
