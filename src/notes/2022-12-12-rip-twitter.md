I'm no longer syndicating my microblog to Twitter. Also removed links to Twitter from my personal website.

Hoping there's a brighter future for platforms like [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/).

Maybe federation really takes off in 2023.

If there's anything hopeful and humane left at Twitter, I hope it somehow survives. In the meantime, I'm happy if the platform's current owner loses another 44 billion dollars.
