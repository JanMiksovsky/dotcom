Oh yeah, Apple’s Macintosh computer is 40 years old now. My first Mac was the [eMac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMac), a discounted all-in-one “education model”, purchased at my college bookstore in 2004 with money earned from a summer job. This was the first computer I bought, and the first computer I used that was not a shared machine.

In retrospect, I should have saved up a little more for the iMac G5. I hauled this 50 lb blob from dorm room to dorm room and apartment to apartment and ran it to its absolute limits again and again. I finally went MacBook Pro starting in 2012, and have been using laptops ever since.

Happy birthday, Mac.
