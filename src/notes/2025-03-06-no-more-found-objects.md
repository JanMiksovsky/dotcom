<p>I am experiencing great mental tension! I believe in the power of anti-art. I think advertising should be illegal. I think good taste is a kind of aesthetic fascism. I see a thousand images a day and I do not remember a single fucking one of them. I want all objects to disappear. I can think of so many artistic practices that use found objects in constellation arrangements, in this exact way I’m describing, that I deeply spiritually enjoy. But I also think there is something here on the table in and amongst all this stuff that feels bad...</p>
<p>...Is this a symptom of the material conditions artists face in the actual real life world? They can’t afford a studio to make stuff. They can’t afford the time to actually make stuff. Practices are made smaller and smaller until assemblage is a shorthand for the fact that art-making takes place via proxy, in theory, concept and gesture.</p>
