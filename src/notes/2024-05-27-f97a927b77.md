It was touching to read Paul Lukas' [farewell post](https://uni-watch.com/2024/05/26/its-uni-watchs-25th-anniversary-and-my-final-day/) and [thank you post](https://uni-watch.com/2024/05/25/i-have-so-many-people-to-thank/) on the Uni Watch blog. This weekend marked the 25th anniversary of [Uni Watch](https://uni-watch.com/), which started as a _Village Voice_ column in 1999, but became one of those indispensable websites emerging from the 2000s, like [Under Consideration](https://underconsideration.com/) and [SportLogos.net](https://www.sportslogos.net/), covering visual culture and branding.

Before Uni Watch came along, there were people who already noticed the [Yankees wear a slightly different interlocking 'NY' emblem](https://uni-watch.com/2021/10/06/a-close-look-at-the-yankees-various-ny-logos/) on their jerseys, hats, and helmets. And once you start seeing these things, you can't unsee them. Uni Watch brought together the lot of sports observers who cared about what the players are wearing, and as it turns out, not only did they care, they also had strong opinions.

Although Paul's no longer at the helm, thankfully the site will continue on. There's tons of great stuff in the archives, too.
