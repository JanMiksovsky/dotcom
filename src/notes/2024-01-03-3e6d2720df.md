> This year, our challenge is “Write 24 in 2024.” Write for 2 to 4 minutes—or for 24 minutes—every day in 2024. Many people share the aim of writing regularly, and many struggle to build a habit that sticks.

I don't know much about Gretchen Rubin, or her books or podcast, but I am going to give this a try in 2024. I'm thinking a [physical journal](https://rhodiapads.com/collections_dot_top_wirebound.php) or a [notes app](https://obsidian.md/) will be the way to go for me, but I know I can commit to _at least_ 2-4 minutes a day, and 24 minutes on weekends. This doesn't mean I'll be publishing everything I write, but the good stuff will probably make it on to the blog in some form.

Relatedly, [Wiggle Work](https://wiggle.work/) is embarking on a writing challenge in February (the shortest month of the year). I plan on participating and I'm thinking about what my goals for a 29 day challenge could look like.
