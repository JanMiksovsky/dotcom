> I don’t find it hard to wear the clothes I make, I wear them every day. At this point the clothes I’ve made now out number the ready to wear items I wear regularly. I make simple clothes that fit with my lifestyle; think jeans, comfy trousers, lots of knit tees, shorts, and the occasional dress. Nothing fancy, the fit isn’t perfect on everything I wear as I’m still learning, but it’s all comfortable and fits me better than ready to wear.

I'm always impressed with people who can make their own clothes. My great-grandmother Nettie made clothes most of her life: for herself, her kids and grandkids and great-grandkids, too. I have a co-worker who took up sewing early during the pandemic and now makes some incredible outfits for himself. My mother in-law made a dress for my daughter and often customizes her own clothing with beautiful embroidery.

It would be useful to learn to sew someday. I'd love to have a few items that were tailored to fit _just right_.
