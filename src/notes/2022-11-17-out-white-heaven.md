Now playing on the turntable: [“Out” by White Heaven](https://www.discogs.com/release/14773032-White-Heaven-Out) 🎵🎶

A friend ordered this and two copies were shipped to him, so I was the lucky beneficiary of the distributor’s mistake. I wasn’t familiar with this Japanese band before, but I am a fan of noisy guitars/psychedelic rock.
