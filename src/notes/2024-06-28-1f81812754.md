_Likes [Mets' Jose Iglesias wrote a song called 'OMG' and players are obsessed with it](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5579159/2024/06/21/mets-jose-iglesias-song-omg/) by Will Sammon._

> Besides playing 12 years in the major leagues and once making an All-Star team, \[Jose\] Iglesias, a 34-year-old from Cuba, creates Latin pop music under the name Candelita. He first introduced “OMG” to the Mets as his walk-up tune upon joining the club from Triple-A Syracuse on May 31. Since then, the Mets (35-38) have coincidentally won 12 of 17 games.

Story's from last week, of course: we are 39-39 right now!

Following a team like the Mets for a whole season is a roller coaster. It's more than just wins or losses; the _vibes_ are important. After such a dismal May, it's good to see the players, and the fans, having **fun**.
