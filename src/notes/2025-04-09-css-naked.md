This is the first year I've decided to observe [CSS Naked Day](https://css-naked-day.org) which lasts as long as it is April 9 (00:00, April 9 UTC+14:00 to 00:00, April 10 UTC-12:00) somewhere around the world. I think I may be a few hours late to remove the CSS stylesheet in my header... of course, I'm terrible at time zones.

> The idea behind CSS Naked Day is to promote web standards. Plain and simple. This includes proper use of HTML, semantic markup, a good hierarchy structure, and of course, a good old play on words. In the words of 2006, itâ€™s time to show off your <code>body</code> for what it really is.
