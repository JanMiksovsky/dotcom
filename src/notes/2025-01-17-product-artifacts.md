Jim Nielsen, “[Don’t Miss the Product for the Artifacts](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/dont-miss-the-product-for-the-artifacts/)“:

<blockquote>
<p>Too often we confuse 1) the artifact created in support of the deliverable, with 2) the deliverable itself.</p>

<p>For example, some designers are awesome at Figma. True wizards at the things they can make. But we’re not Figma designers. We’re app designers, web designers, product designers. Figma is just the tool that facilitates creating the thing we actually want to make. Yet we can spend so much time thinking “being good at Figma” is our purpose, when in fact it’s to use Figma to build something great for people!</p>
