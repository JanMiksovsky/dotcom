So I appreciate how easy hover.com has made the whole domain name thing for years, but $18 for each .com I have there is kinda steep for a renewal price. I'm moving stuff over and recommending [porkbun.com](https://porkbun.com/) from now on. Please don't tell me this is a horrible company whose founder kills elephants.
