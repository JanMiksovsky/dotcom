I spent some time today at the Albuquerque Museum, taking in the O'Keefe and Moore exhibit. Apparently, this exhibition is the first that unites the work of both Georgia O'Keefe and Henry Moore.

[Exhibition description](https://www.cabq.gov/artsculture/albuquerque-museum/exhibitions/okeeffe-and-moore):

> While Georgia O’Keeffe was holding up a small pelvic bone of a gray fox against the New Mexico sky, framing the landscape and imagining the curve of the bone on a vast scale, Henry Moore, eleven years her junior and half way around the world, was also holding up small bones, maquettes, and other objects against the sky, imagining them any size and peering through their apertures to the open landscape and sheep fields of Hertfordshire. The two artists pioneered and shared a coherent vision and approach to Modernism. While other Modernist artists also used natural forms as a pathway to abstraction, no other artists apart from O’Keeffe and Moore centered their art on this fundamental aspect, and amassed such great collections over their lifetimes of animal skulls and bones, gnarled tree roots and twisted driftwood, smooth and hollowed river and flint stones, internal coils of seashells and interlocking pebbles...This exhibition unites the work of these artists for the first time, and re-creates their studios in the Museum with their original contents of found objects, tools, and furnishings.  Visitors will be able to explore their working practices, and see how these humble objects inspired some of their most important artistic creations.
