In IndieWeb parlance, [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) means Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere. I like the concept. Today, I'm changing a few things about how I syndicate my content.

All my main feeds ([posts](/posts/), [notes](/notes/), [likes](/likes/)) will continue to automatically syndicate to [my account over at Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/nsmsn). Micro.blog is a wonderful platform. While I no longer host my content there, I will still syndicate and interact with the community.

I turned off automatic cross-posting to my [Bluesky account](https://bsky.app/profile/nicksimson.com) and my [Mastodon account](https://mastodon.design/@nsmsn). The way Micro.blog [handles cross-posting](https://micro.blog/about/indieweb) is nice, but I want to have a little more control over what my notes and posts look like on these platforms. They are similar to Micro.blog, but different in many ways too. Not just in the way links look and character limits, either.

When I look at my timeline on either of these apps, it...looks like a bot.

So I find myself deleting many of the automatic Bluesky copies and editing the Mastodon ones later, because I'm fickle about how these things look. So I'm going to always post here first, but will try manually cross-posting to Bluesky, Mastodon, and [elsewhere](https://nicksimson.com/links/). My hope is that this will make me more intentional about what I share and how I share it.

Also, maybe not every post on my website needs to be versioned on another social network. I'm going to try being OK with that, too.
