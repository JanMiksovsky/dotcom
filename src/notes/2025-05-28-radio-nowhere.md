Dave Purcell, [Radio Nowhere: A Love Letter To Independent Music Blogs](https://scummywatertower.com/artist-essays/artist-essay-radio-nowhere-a-love-letter-to-independent-music-blogs-by-dave-purcell/)

> In a music world run by metrics, algorithms, and social media, these blogs are beautifully, stubbornly human. They don’t rely on hype or Spotify picks to tell them what matters — they listen. They take chances on artists without a PR team or a marketing budget. That act alone, in this numbing age of sensory overload and distraction, feels almost revolutionary.
