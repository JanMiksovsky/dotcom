I added a new page to my site at [/loves](/loves.html).

I already have IndieWeb "likes", but I thought it would be nice to add a site section for things I love, or have meant a lot to me over the past decades. Currently: favorite newspaper comics, sports teams, music, and "Misc."

Loosely inspired by [The Loved List](https://ankursethi.in/the-loved-list/) by Ankur Sethi, and anyone else who has something similar on their personal site.
