In "[The Interface Is The Interview](https://blog.ronbronson.com/the-interface-is-the-interview)" Ron Bronson also has some things to say about the job search/hiring process: 

> We need _interoperability standards_ for how people apply for jobs. It is completely chaotic to ask people to write for interfaces that may or may not connect to humans. Or may connect to humans _through_ a parser. Or _through_ an LLM. Or _through_ some recruiter dashboard that flattens their whole story into three data points. Most people don’t know which one they’re interacting with, and they’re burning hours trying to optimize across all of them at once.
