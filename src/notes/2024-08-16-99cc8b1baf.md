_Bookmarked [Font with Built-In Syntax Highlighting](https://blog.glyphdrawing.club/font-with-built-in-syntax-highlighting/)._

> This lead me to think: **could it be possible to build syntax highlighting directly into a font**, skipping JavaScript altogether? Could I somehow leverage OpenType features, by creating colored glyphs with the COLR table, and identifying and substituting code syntax with contextual alternates?...  
>   
> ...The colors in the HTML snippet above **comes from within the font itself**, the code is **plain text**, and requires **no JavaScript**.
