I learned this morning that my mom’s brother died, after fighting a lung cancer diagnosis this past year and entering hospice care this month. My mom was able to be there for his last moments, as were his kids.

I’ll always remember my Uncle Earl as a man with a gigantic heart. He was fiercely loyal to everyone he considered his kin. As the older brother, he was always there for my mom. In the last couple years, he moved to Oneida so he could be as close as possible to my grandmother, and to care for her as best as he could. He had the most generous spirit, too. He treated my sister and me as if we were his own children.

I managed to talk to him on Christmas Day and thanked him for all these things.

Miss you, Earl.
