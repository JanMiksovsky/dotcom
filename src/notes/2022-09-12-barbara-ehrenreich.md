Know Your Enemy (podcast): [On Barbara Ehrenreich (w/ Alex Press & Gabriel Winant)](https://know-your-enemy-1682b684.simplecast.com/episodes/on-barbara-ehrenreich-w-alex-press-gabriel-winant) üéôÔ∏è

> This episode was unplanned, but when Barbara Ehrenreich died on September 1, 2022, we felt an urge to honor her memory and the profound influence she has had on the American left, socialism, feminism, and our collective thinking about class struggle. From her work in the women‚Äôs health movement of the 1960s, to her theorizing (with ex-husband John Ehrenreich) of the ‚Äúprofessional-managerial class‚Äù in the 1970s, to her explorations of Reagan-era yuppie pathologies, and her renowned expos√© of low-wage work in 2001‚Äôs _Nickel and Dimed_, Barbara Ehrenreich has been an essential and nuanced guide to the inner-life of American class conflict in the latter half of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st.

It‚Äôs been nearly 20 years since I read _Nickel and Dimed_, assigned to all incoming freshmen at my college. I have since read some of Ehrenreich‚Äôs other 21st century books, in particular I remember _Bait and Switch_ and _Bright-Sided_ being quite good.

Rest in Peace.
