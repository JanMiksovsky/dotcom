I'd like to automate something simple on my website: When I use the [IndieBlocks Bookmark block](https://indieblocks.xyz/documentation/the-bookmark-like-reply-and-repost-blocks/), I'd also like to automatically apply the [Bookmarks tag](https://nicksimson.com/tags/bookmarks/) to my note.

This is just a note to self to write a little plugin or something to automate this.
