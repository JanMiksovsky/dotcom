_Likes [Kottke.org Redesigns With 2024 Vibes](https://kottke.org/24/03/kottkeorg-redesigns-with-2024-vibes)._

> In thinking about how I wanted kottke.org to look and, more importantly, _feel_ going forward, I wanted more social media energy than blog energy — one could also say “more old school blog energy than contemporary blog energy”. Blogs now either look like Substack/Medium or [Snow Fall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snow_Fall) and I didn’t want to pattern kottke.org after either of those things. I don’t want to write articles — I want to blog.

Jason Kottke has been running his site so long...I appreciate how his redesigns are always so fresh and keeping with the contemporary web zeitgeist when they come out. Love the commitment to not having a logo, either. I dig the permutations on the "planets" with this latest design.
