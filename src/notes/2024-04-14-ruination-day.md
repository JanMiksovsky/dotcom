juliawick, [Gillian Welch on How April 14th Came to Be ‘Ruination Day’](https://longreads.com/2015/04/14/gillian-welch-on-how-april-14th-came-to-be-ruination-day/):

> April 14 marks the anniversary of three awful, fabled events: the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln in 1865; the Titanic striking an iceberg in 1912 (it sunk in the wee hours of the 15th); and the Black Sunday dust storm of 1935. Gillian Welch first brought attention to this foreboding historical confluence on her 2001 album _[Time (The Revelator)](https://www.gillianwelch.com/albums/),_ which has two songs chronicling the events of April 14: “April the 14th, Part 1” and “Ruination Day, Part 2.”
