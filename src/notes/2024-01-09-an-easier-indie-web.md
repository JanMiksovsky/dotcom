_Likes [gilest.org: Make the indie web easier](https://gilest.org/indie-easy.html)._

_Likes [gilest.org: More on the easier indie web](https://gilest.org/indie-easy-again.html)._

Seeing these two posts from [Giles](https://gilest.org/) bouncing all over the web today. [BJ has a great response](https://bjhess.pika.page/posts/making-the-web-easier-for-blogging). [So does Colin](https://colinwalker.blog/blog/?date=2024-01-08#p2). [And Kev too](https://kevquirk.com/lets-make-the-indieweb-easier).

I love WordPress. I love Micro.blog and Neocities. I want to see these things continue to thrive. I also want to see even more products invade the personal website space. I want to see more normies and non-techies proliferate on the indie web. I've never set up a Medium or Substack account. But I'm imagining an onboarding that is _at least_ as easy as those two things.

I just switched to WordPress, and am not ready to ditch WordPress. As a semi-techy guy it makes it easy for me to participate in all the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) stuff. [40% of the web](https://wordpress.org/40-percent-of-web/) being powered by WordPress is great for [Matt](https://ma.tt/) plus all the [companies](https://chriscoyier.net/2023/09/20/wordpress-hosting-advice/) that just specialize in supporting WordPress. I'm not so sure it's great for the health of the web at large.

It would be cool if I had the know-how to create my own CMS. It'd be even _cooler_ to create something that made it easier (and cheaper!) for others to experience the same joy I get writing, designing, and hanging out on my very own website.
