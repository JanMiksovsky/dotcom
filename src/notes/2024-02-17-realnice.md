20+ years ago it was a thing for folks to make [MySpace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myspace) profiles for their pals. I've been thinking lately how I want all my pals to have their own personal website, and how I might help them make one.

[realnice](https://getrealnice.com/) looks real promising. They set out to build a good-looking website builder that was simpler and cheaper than Wix or Squarespace. As their co-founders say, if you can edit a Google doc, you can build a website with their product. There's nothing to download or install, and a realnice site is easy to update and maintain. You just have to remember to renew your domain name each year.

A one-page site with minimal realnice branding is free. It's $4 a month to remove the branding and add multiple pages. And if you don't have a domain name yet, they'll give you one free for the first year.
