These photos were taken Friday afternoon, when we started harvesting apricots off our backyard tree. By Sunday we filled a whole bucket, and we'll be blanching the fruits and freezing them for recipes next.

After that, it's apricot cobbler, apricot salsa, apricot jam...maybe some other fun stuff too.
