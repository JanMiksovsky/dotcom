Thanks for taking the time to read my post, Jan, and for providing additional insight into IndieBlocks' webmention functionality.

Last night, I tried disabling the Webmention plugin and enabling IndieBlocks' implementation. Things work, but I couldn't figure out how to get profile images to display on previous facepiles and replies. Happy to take this discussion to GitHub issues if necessary.
