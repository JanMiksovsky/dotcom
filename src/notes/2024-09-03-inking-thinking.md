_Bookmarked [Self Inking Custom Made Rubber Stamp](https://www.modernmakerstamps.com/custom-stamp/self-inking)._

Clearly I'm on an inking kick.

So a year or two ago I had to get something notarized, and the notary had one of these cool self-inking stamps. I am thinking about ordering something similar with my phone number and email address on it. Then, combined with my [new logo stamp](https://nicksimson.com/posts/rubber-stamped/), plus some repurposed paper (and some ink refills) I could have an endless supply of 2-color business cards.

I already know how to design and order business cards, but this handmade recycled approach sounds cooler, and (maybe?) more sustainable.
