[The Checkup](https://forms.technologyreview.com/newsletters/biotech-the-checkup/) is a promising new email newsletter from MIT Technology Review.

> Every week I’ll be covering what I think are the most exciting, fascinating, and controversial developments in health, medical science, and biotech—and how they might help diagnose, treat, enhance, or even harm us. Thanks for joining me!

[The first issue](https://mailchi.mp/technologyreview.com/welcome-to-the-checkup-this-week-consciousness-832462) includes an interview with Dr. John Whyte, who studies disorders of consciousness, attempts to pull people in this state back into consciousness, and recovery of patients with severe traumatic brain injury.
