_Likes [What Would It Take to Recreate Bell Labs?](https://www.construction-physics.com/p/what-would-it-take-to-recreate-bell) by Brian Potter._

> Unfortunately, the conditions that made Bell Labs so successful were highly historically contingent and not the sort of thing that could be deliberately recreated. Being a subsidiary of a government-sanctioned, vertically integrated monopoly gave Bell Labs a broad research scope and freedom to pursue long-term research projects unavailable to most other industrial labs. Prior discoveries in quantum mechanics provided a wealth of new phenomena that Bell Labs could harvest for new technology, and WWII both pushed technology forward across the board and turned Bell Labs into an organization poised to capitalize on it. In the end, Bell Labs was ultimately undermined by the very technologies that it had created. The world that Bell Labs thrived in no longer exists: to push technological progress forward, we'll need to understand both why Bell Labs worked and why it no longer could.

I was glad to see _[The Idea Factory](https://bookshop.org/a/21729/9780143122791)_ by John Gertner cited so much in this mini-history of Bell Labs. That book was a pretty compelling read.
