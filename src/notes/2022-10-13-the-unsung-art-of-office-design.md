Bloomberg: [The Unsung Art of Office Design](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2022-10-04/the-unsung-art-of-office-design)

An interview with architects and designers LeeAnn Suen and Florian Idenburg on their new book about office design.

> Architecture has a very interesting relationship with, say, reality; maybe with capitalism. The architect wants to position themself as a critical person who tries to — or claims to — work for the people, against the system. So office work is very rarely celebrated, because it’s considered participating within the system, rather than taking a critical distance or sort of an opposition to that.
