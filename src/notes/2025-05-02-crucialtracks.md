Jason, "[The joy of Crucial Tracks](https://www.crucialtracks.org/the-joy-of-crucial-tracks/)":

> I'm going to do my best to keep that feeling going, but I also understand we've all been trained over the last 20+ years for "engagement", through algorithms and just getting bombarded with information. The slowness might be hard to handle at first, but I want this site to be different. I just hope that feeling is enough to keep folks interested and coming back. It feels like a radical idea, so I'll have my fingers crossed.

I have only started [posting to Crucial Tracks](https://app.crucialtracks.org/profile/nsmsn) this May, but I like the format (one song per day, per user) so far, and listening to the stuff shared on the public timeline. I think this is the way music discovery should work. Eager to see where this goes.
