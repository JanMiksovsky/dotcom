I got early access to a managed version of [Equalify](https://equalify.app/), an open source accessibility platform by Blake Bertuccelli. Right now, the main integration is with [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/), an automated accessibility checker, with integrations with both Drupal and WordPress coming soon. Check out the [app roadmap](https://equalify.app/roadmap/), and [repo on GitHub](https://github.com/bbertucc/equalify).

As I spend more time using the product, I hope to write up a more detailed overview with screenshots.
