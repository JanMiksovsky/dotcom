No Depression: [Sam Bush performs John Hartfordâ€™s â€˜In Tall Buildingsâ€™](https://www.nodepression.com/spotlight-towering-memories-inspire-sam-bushs-version-of-john-hartfords-in-tall-buildings-video/) ðŸŽµðŸ“º

A faithful version of one of my favorite songs. Sam Bush was the mandolinist on Hartfordâ€™s 1976 album _Nobody Knows What You Do_, which features this song.
