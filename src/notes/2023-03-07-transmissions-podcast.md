Started listening to [Transmissions (the podcast)](https://art19.com/shows/transmissions) this week 🎙️.

Transmissions, narrated by Maxine Peake, tells the story of Joy Division and New Order through interviews, recordings and examines the influence of the music today. This audio documentary was released in 2020.

Thrilled to hear [Peter Saville](https://petersaville.info/)’s participation as one of the interviewees in this project. Saville talks about the design of the iconic Joy Division and New Order record sleeves he designed in the early 1980s.
