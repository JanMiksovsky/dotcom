_Likes [Bluesky backfeed support in Bridgy](https://www.joelotter.com/posts/2023/10/bridgy-bluesky/) by Joel Auterson._

I decided to set up [Brid.gy](https://brid.gy/)/[Bridgy Fed](https://fed.brid.gy/) on my website this week for both Bluesky and Mastodon. Likes and comments are now getting pulled in. I have a [mirror of my feed with Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/nsmsn), and I'm still using that for cross-posting.
