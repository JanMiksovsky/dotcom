_Bookmarked [RsS iS dEaD LOL](https://rss-is-dead.lol/)._

I love the layout of the user profilesâ€”[here's mine](https://rss-is-dead.lol/user?profileUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmastodon.design%2Fusers%2Fnsmsn).

Surprising there are publications and news outlets that don't use RSS anymore. Also weird that a couple WordPress blogs with the ActivityPub plugin don't show up with the RSS icon.
