JosÃ©: [Dinosaurs, the Sitcom Before Time (YouTube video)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=LzN6ls_pzvo) ðŸ“º

I remember watching this series as a little kid (we were an ABC TGIF household) in the early 1990s, but I donâ€™t remember this having such a Point of View.

Behind the animatronics and full body puppets brought to life by the Jim Henson Company were messages about religion, capitalism, feminism, social control, colonialism, and the environment.

There was an episode that mirrored the Anita Hill and Clarence Thomas hearings, which were going on at the time. A bunch of the surnames in the show were actual fossil fuel companies, and the company the main character worked for had a logo reminiscent of the Dupont corporation. **Spoiler alert**: Environmental destruction and actions taken by Earlâ€™s employer bring about a mass extinction event at the very end of the series.

Looking at it now, Iâ€™m a bit surprised that this was something my Reagan and Bush supporting parents (my dad was also a Rush Limbaugh listener) allowed us to watch, watched with us, and bought us toys based on. But they were also fans of _All in the Family_, which along with _The Flintstones_, was an inspiration behind this show.

Kevin Clash, the performer behind the Baby Sinclair puppet, was also the puppeteer and voice of Sesame Streetâ€™s Elmo, and Jessica Walter, who voiced the mother, would later portray Lucille Bluth on Arrested Development.
