I rented a car recently and the worker behind the counter recognized my email address was a personal domain name. We ended up chatting for a bit about web development and WordPress and even Netlify.

Having email on your own domain name is like knowing a secret handshake or wearing a “Talk to me about websites” badge on your chest.
