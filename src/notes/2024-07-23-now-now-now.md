Made a couple updates to my [/now page](https://nicksimson.com/now/).

This thing is now powered by several widgets pulling in stuff automatically, plus some blocks of text I update manually.

From top to bottom:

1. My latest status, powered by [status.lol](https://nsmsn.status.lol/).  
    _(daily-ish?)_

3. What I'm up to these days, powered by the block editor.  
    _(seasonally)_

5. My current pile of books, powered by [Literal](https://literal.club/pages/widget).  
    _(monthly)_

7. Latest tracks from Last.fm, powered by this [pretty good Vercel app](https://github.com/JeffreyCA/lastfm-recently-played-readme).  
    _(daily)_

9. The current weather in Albuquerque, powered by the [Location Weather plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/location-weather/) (which is itself powered by the Open Weather Map API).  
    _(hourly)_

I signed up for a [Letterboxd account](https://letterboxd.com/nsmsn/) recently, and I might add a widget for that next if I can find a good one. But I don't watch a lot of movies these days, so I don't know how appropriate it is for my /now page.

I like to think of a now page as a snapshot in time, and mine is a mix of things that are updated hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or on an ongoing basis.

If I were a better programmer this would all be APIs, not this fragile mix of third-party widgets. What's nice is that none of this third-party stuff contains [ad trackers or cookies](https://themarkup.org/blacklight?url=nicksimson.com%252Fnow) (as best as I can tell).
