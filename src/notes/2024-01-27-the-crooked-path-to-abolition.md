Finished reading _[The Crooked Path to Abolition: Abraham Lincoln and the Antislavery Constitutio](https://micro.blog/books/9781324005858)n_ by James Oakes, ISBN: 9781324005858 ðŸ“š

I picked this one up because I enjoyed Oakes' earlier book _The Scorpion's Sting_ so much. This book is similar in length, around 200 pages. It's a quick, illuminating read about Abraham Lincoln and the antislavery strategies of his presidency, culminating in the Thirteenth Amendment.
