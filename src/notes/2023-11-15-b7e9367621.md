Joined a virtual listening party for [When the Roses Come Again](https://threelobed.bandcamp.com/album/when-the-roses-come-again) by Daniel Bachman (2023 Three Lobed Recordings) while I loaded the dishwasher this evening. ðŸŽ¶

I want Bandcamp the platform to survive. I want the workers at Bandcamp to thrive. I want the small labels and unsigned musicians to have enough to pay the bills and feed their loved ones and quit their day jobs, too.
