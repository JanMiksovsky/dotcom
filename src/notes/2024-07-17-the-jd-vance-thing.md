_In reply to [Dunking on J.D. Vance’s ‘Hillbilly Elegy’ Is ‘Unusual Behavior,’ Goodreads Says](https://www.404media.co/j-d-vance-hillbilly-elegy-goodreads-reviews/?ref=daily-stories-newsletter)._

Years ago, when this _Hillbilly Elegy_ book came out, I was living in an Appalachian city (Knoxville, Tennessee). I was interested in the response from people who grew up in this diverse region, and sought out the opinions of people who read Vance's book. I did end up borrowing a copy from the library, to see what the fuss was about.

If you're interested in critique, pick up _[What You Are Getting Wrong about Appalachia](https://www.arcadiapublishing.com/products/9780998904146)_, Elizabeth Catte's searing response to Vance, published in 2018.

> In 2016, headlines declared Appalachia ground zero for America's forgotten tribe of white working class voters. Journalists flocked to the region to extract sympathetic profiles of families devastated by poverty, abandoned by establishment politics, and eager to consume cheap campaign promises. What You Are Getting Wrong About Appalachia is a frank assessment of America's recent fascination with the people and problems of the region. The book analyzes trends in contemporary writing on Appalachia, presents a brief history of Appalachia with an eye toward unpacking Appalachian stereotypes, and provides examples of writing, art, and policy created by Appalachians as opposed to for Appalachians. The book offers a must-needed insider's perspective on the region.

For another historical perspective at the region, I also recommend [_Ramp Hollow_ by Steven Stoll](https://bookshop.org/a/21729/9780809080199).

True, Appalachia is represented by some of the most conservative politicians in the U.S. today, but has its own tradition of radical organizing on the left. Check out titles from the [Highlander Center bookstore](https://highlandercenter.org/shop/) for further historical and contemporary reading.
