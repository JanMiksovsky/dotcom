_Likes [RSS readers make me want to jump into a vat of acid!](https://gkeenan.co/avgb/rss-readers-make-me-want-to-jump-into-a-vat-of-acid) by Keenan._

I love [my RSS reader](https://netnewswire.com/), but I do appreciate reading other opinions. I do occasionally open items from my RSS app in the browser for a few reasons:

- The site's RSS feeds are truncated.

- There's embedded media or CodePens or whatever that just doesn't translate to the RSS app.

- I know the reading experience on the original website will actually be better (no ads or popups, carefully chosen typography) than my RSS app.
