_Bookmarked [How I Use Obsidian](https://mattstein.com/thoughts/how-i-use-obsidian/) by Matt Stein._

I appreciate Matt's deep dive into how his digital brain works. I just may have to give Obsidian a try, especially since it prioritizes personal _file ownership_. I've been keeping notes in Notion for about a year, and still have stuff trapped in Evernote from nearly a decade before that.
