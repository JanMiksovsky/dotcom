_Likes [Word Wrap Podcast: Does valid and semantic HTML still matter?](https://wordwrap.dev/episodes/s2/014/)._

Great discussion with [Ben Myers](https://benmyers.dev/).

> Our mission is to make the most usable user experience. And so the way to do that, the secret sauce, is to give the device as much information as possible, to be as expressive as possible about our intent, so that the device has all the information it needs to be able to create the most usable user experience. And that is what semantics is forâ€¦I believe personally, that expressiveness beats out any other mantra about code cleanliness or anything like that. And writing expressive code has never led me astray.
