_Likes [Book wish lists...](https://cagrimmett.com/micro/aa01701284/) by Chuck Grimmett._

> Book wish lists are like black holes. Inspirations and interests are so fleeting that one must act upon them immediately, or they are more than likely gone forever. Get books when they catch your eye, for your eye wanders.
> 
> If you are one of the lucky ones who does happen to have a fleeting interest again in a book you passed up months or years earlier, you now have a special tie and must get that book right away. It is reaching out to you, pulling you in. Heed its call.
