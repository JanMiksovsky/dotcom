_In reply to [Semi-Annual Reminder to Learn and Hire for Web Standards â€” Adrian Roselli](https://adrianroselli.com/2024/09/semi-annual-reminder-to-learn-and-hire-for-web-standards.html)._

I think it would be compelling and helpful to somehow feature a short list of companies who **do** hire for deep knowledge/experience of web standards. Consultancies like [Igalia](https://www.igalia.com/) or [Bocoup](https://www.bocoup.com/) come to mind.

And recognizing that higher education and bootcamp programs have not all standardized to a proper web standards curriculum yet, companies that offer apprenticeships/learning paths/mentorship for junior employees in learning web standards on the job should be highlighted as well. [Sparkbox's apprenticeship program](https://apprentices.sparkbox.com/), for example looks very promising.

Maybe there's a public list or pledge that companies and orgs could sign on to.
