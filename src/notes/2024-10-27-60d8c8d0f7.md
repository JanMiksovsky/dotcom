_Bookmarked [Authors Apart](https://alandalton.github.io/Authors-Apart/) by Alan Dalton._

Alan Dalton is keeping track of where authors of [A Book Apart](https://abookapart.com/pages/about/) have made their books available, for purchase or for free, after the publisher closed and ownership and publishing rights were restored to the authors.

In my first year into my first real web design job I bought the first four ABA titles, and still have these plus a handful of other slim, colorful tomes on my shelf. I'm glad these resources will continue to be available, some at free or reduced price. Essential for any web designer's library.
