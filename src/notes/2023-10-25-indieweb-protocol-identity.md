_Likes [A cohesive and unified identity for IndieWeb protocols](https://paulrobertlloyd.com/2023/298/a1/indieweb_identity/) by Paul Robert Lloyd._

> I often find myself noodling on ideas for how these logos might work. In the run up to this weekend’s IndieWebCamp in Nuremberg, I had another go. While not by any means my final proposal, what I’m sharing here, I think, could provide a starting point for kicking off a discussion about what a cohesive identity for these protocols might look like.

I dig Paul's proposal here and think he's really honored the homegrown aspect of the current IndieWeb visual identity, while creating a _cohesive_ system. I'm excited to see if this takes off, and how it takes shape.
