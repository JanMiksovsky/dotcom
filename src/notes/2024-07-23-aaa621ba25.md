I have a personal [statuslog](https://nsmsn.status.lol/) now, powered by [omg.lol](https://omg.lol/). Here's how I'm using it:

1. I pick a [Fluent emoji](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-emoji) from the emoji picker and type something. The `<h1>` on my status page says "**Nick is...**" so I start each status in lower case to finish the sentence. The grammar gets a bit weird when it's a mixture of third-person and "I" statements, but I think folks can still follow along.

3. Since [my Mastodon account](https://social.lol/@nsmsn) is also part of my omg.lol subscription, I can automatically post my status to the Fediverse from status.lol.

5. My statuslog has a built-in [RSS feed](https://nsmsn.status.lol/feed). I pull this in as a source in [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/) and automatically cross-post it to [my Bluesky account](https://bsky.app/profile/nicksimson.com), too. If I end up using more than 300 characters in a simple status update, I am probably in distress. Send help.

7. The status.lol service has a [simple javascript widget](https://home.omg.lol/info/statuslog) you can embed on nearly any web page, so I am sharing only my latest status update on both my [/now page](https://nicksimson.com/now/) and my [omg.lol profile](https://nsmsn.omg.lol).

9. Other than the embed, I am not currently creating a local copy of a status to store on my website. I'm treating statuses as ephemeral.

Before last week, I didn't think I needed a subscription to omg.lol. But I enjoy playing around with [each little feature](https://home.omg.lol/info), and supporting something small that mainly exists for fun. I know I've certainly spent twenty dollars on stupider things.
