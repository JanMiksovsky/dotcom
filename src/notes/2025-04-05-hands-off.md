My wife and I tried explaining to our three year old why we were going downtown today for the [Hands Off](https://handsoff2025.com/) day of action. 

When we got home our little girl asked “Did those bad guys decide to be nice and share?” 

“Unfortunately not, that’s why we have to keep speaking up,” was the best answer I could come up with.
