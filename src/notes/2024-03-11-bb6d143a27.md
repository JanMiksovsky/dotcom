_In reply to [Websites as gardens of the Internet ecosystem](https://tracydurnell.com/2024/03/04/websites-as-gardens-of-the-internet-ecosystem/) by Tracy Durnell._

After moving back to the American Southwest last year, I've taken an interest in [desert xeriscaping](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/xeriscaping/), gardening that requires little or no water beyond what the natural climate provides.

I'm sure there's a metaphor for digital gardening in this too...optimizing a website for performance? Designing with [progressive enhancement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Progressive_Enhancement)? Creating a zero carbon website or one with a minimal [carbon footprint](https://www.websitecarbon.com/)?
