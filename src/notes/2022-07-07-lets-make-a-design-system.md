_Likes [Let's Make a Design System!](https://frontend.horse/episode/lets-make-a-design-system/)._

I bookmarked this to watch a while ago and I’m glad I took the time to watch it. This is a replay of a live Twitch stream hosted by Alex Trost, with Mike Aparicio sharing many lessons he’s learned from building design systems. As a demo, Mike did a CSS refactor and built a fledgling design system based on the [frontend.horse](https://frontend.horse/) home page, walking through the steps he took to get there. If you’re new to building design systems, I think this is a fantastic introduction.

This video clocks in at 2 hours, 45 minutes (I watched at 1.25 speed). I typically do not consume my web design/development knowledge this way—give me a 45 minute talk or 15 minute technical article, please!

Thankfully, there’s a ton of useful information here, and I took notes. The project comes with [extensive documentation](https://fh-tack.netlify.app/) with all the links and a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/peruvianidol/frontend-horse) you can comb through. Really appreciate the time and care Alex and Mike put into this.
