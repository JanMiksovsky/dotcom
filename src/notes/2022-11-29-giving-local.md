Today is Giving Tuesday, a global holiday for charitable giving initiated ten years ago. These days I try to support smaller, **local** organizations mobilizing poor and working people.

On my blog this morning [I highlighted some orgs](/posts/2022-giving-tuesday.html) that touch the lives of people in places I’ve called home: Upstate NY, Arizona, and Tennessee.

I also highlighted the [Chicago Freedom School](https://www.chicagofreedomschool.org/about), and the [Debs-Jones-Douglass Institute](https://djdinstitute.org/), two orgs I believe are keeping Martin Luther King Jr.’s dream and legacy alive today.

I can’t tell you what to do with your money, but I encourage to find out who is helping and organizing in your communities and fund them. I hope you’ll be radical and generous this holiday season.
