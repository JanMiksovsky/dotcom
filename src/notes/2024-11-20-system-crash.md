Does the world need another weekly tech news podcast? Maybe it does... I'm eagerly anticipating episode one of [System Crash](https://systemcrash.info/), a new show hosted by Brian Merchant (author of _[Blood in the Machine](https://bookshop.org/a/21729/9780316487740)_) and Paris Marx (host of [Tech Won't Save Us](https://www.techwontsave.us/)). The show debuts this Friday.
