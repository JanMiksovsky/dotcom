_Likes [AI Writing Code](https://bits.justmarkup.com/1670314937889/)._

> Writing actual code is, at least for me, a very small part of my job as a frontend developer, and I would even argue one of the least important. ... Itâ€™s far more important to communicate well, make decisions, be able to adapt. Computers are not good at this, humans are.
