<p>I was submitting to authority for protection. In my mind, a publisher would take care of me. They’d help me make my book better. They’d help me find my audience. They’d make sure the book got in front of people who’d buy it. They’d do all of the things that authors generally don’t like doing, and allow me to focus on what I wanted to do, which was writing. Getting that gold star from an authority figure feels really good. This goes beyond authors and publishers, of course...</p>
