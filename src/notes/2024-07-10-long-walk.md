I finally finished reading _[Long Walk to Freedom: The Autobiography of Nelson Mandela](https://bookshop.org/a/21729/9780316548182)_ (ISBN: 9780316548182).

I started this book back in late 2022, which I only remember because it was one of the final status updates I posted on the website formerly known as Twitter. The book details Mandela's early life, education, his involvement with the [African National Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_National_Congress) (ANC), and his 27 year imprisonment. The book ends with Mandela's release from prison, the beginning of the end of apartheid in South Africa, and the new government's first democratic election after the end of the apartheid government.

I'm glad I finally finished this book. Nelson Mandela looms large among figures who have influenced my outlook on politics, democracy, and the world in general.
