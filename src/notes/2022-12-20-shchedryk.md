Rice University: [‘Carol of the Bells’ wasn’t originally a Christmas song](https://news.rice.edu/news/2004/carol-bells-wasnt-originally-christmas-song)🎵

> “Very few people realize that the composition ‘Shchedryk’ was composed and performed during a time when there was intense political struggle and social upheaval in Ukraine…The same choir director who commissioned the song formed the Ukrainian National Chorus, mandated by a fledgling Ukrainian government, in 1919 to promote Ukranian music in major cultural centers in the West. Touring across Europe and North and South America, the chorus performed over 1,000 concerts.”
