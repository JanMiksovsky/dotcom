I got bored of my photo and decided to update most [my social networking profiles](https://nicksimson.com/links/) with a new avatar this week. I have not done much cartooning (or a self portrait) in a long time.Â 

I thought about making a "pixel-perfect" version, but for now I kinda like the inky lines and roughness of auto-trace.
