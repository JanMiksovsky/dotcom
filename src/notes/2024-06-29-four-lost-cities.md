I recently finished reading _[Four Lost Cities: A Secret History of the Urban Age](https://bookshop.org/a/21729/9780393882452)_, by Annalee Newitz. (ISBN: 9780393652666)

By "recently," I mean I finished this weeks ago, and have been struggling a bit to write a review. Overall, I liked the book. Newitz traveled to the ancient cities of Çatalhöyük, Pompeii, Angkor, and Cahokia, and interviewed archaeologists and experts at each site. The book is a bit like a travelogue back in time, and I enjoyed learning a little archaeology and anthropology through Newitz's accessible writing.
