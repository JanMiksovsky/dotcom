_Likes [The Loved List](https://ankursethi.in/the-loved-list/) by Ankur Sethi._

I do like this idea. A short (very short) list of favorite media (books, music, games) on one's own website.

> Everything on the list has either had a lasting emotional impact on me, or changed the way I think in a significant way. A few pieces of media are listed here because I believe they represent the best example of a certain genre or style.  
>   
> This list is constantly changing. Some things donâ€™t pass the test of time, while others become more important to me as I change and grow as a person. Regardless, this list is a good snapshot of my tastes and interests in the present moment.
