Just finished reading _[Don't Call It That: A Naming Workbook](https://micro.blog/books/9781734248302)_ by Eli Altman, ISBN: 9781734248302 ðŸ“š

This is a helpful workbook if you are struggling to give your company or product an interesting name. The author points out repeatedly it's actually a bigger risk to go with something boring or generic. The final chapter has some helpful info from a trademark attorney, too.
