> I’m finding WordPress so obtuse and vaguely enshittified that it‘s not worth the hassle. This falls into stark relief when I start playing with Kirby. Its templating system is simple, logical and flexible enough that I got it to ouput _exactly_ what I wanted in a post template and header and footer snippets in an hour or so.

I'm really curious to try out [Kirby](https://getkirby.com/) more and more. I have a blog post brewing about what exactly I want in a blogging platform/content management system these days.
