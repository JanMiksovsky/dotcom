_Bookmarked [Lessons from America’s first and most radical human-centered designers](https://rosenfeldmedia.com/sessions/warming-the-user-experience/) by Rosenfeld Media._

I enjoyed this presentation by Daniel Gloyd, who has been working on a [book about Shaker design](https://www.theshakerbook.com/).

> The Shakers exemplified both the principles and the courage to practice design in a manner that looked after the human experience of life on earth.
> 
> We’ll look behind the famous Shaker objects that inspired Dieter Rams and Jonathan Ives to appreciate the Shakers’ most important contribution to the American design canon; a transcendent user experience (ZX) warmed by principles of connectivity that we humans need in order to thrive.
> 
> This talk is intended to remind designers who shape our experiences today that without this warmth the modern world grows cold around us.
