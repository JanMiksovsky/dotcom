Today is Father’s Day in the U.S., which means I’m listening to more “dad rock” than usual. For me, this is classic rock like The Band, Neil Young, Bruce Springsteen, The Rolling Stones, etc.

My own father was heavy into prog rock, too. I might put on some Yes, Genesis, and Supertramp later, and remember my old man.
