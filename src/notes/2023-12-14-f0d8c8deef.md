> Children abound in Gaza, making up more than half of the population of over 2 million. The majority are descendants of refugees, and most have already lived through several Israeli attacks on their territory, knowing nothing beyond the confines of walls, razor wire, no-go zones and naval blockades. Art is a common form of children’s therapy in Gaza, and when a Palestinian child is given a set of crayons, horizontal stick figures dotted in red often appear under fighter jets and tanks. Some 95% of Gazan children were already living below the poverty line before the current offensive, 80% of them dependent on rations from UNRWA, the United Nations branch dedicated to supporting Palestinian refugees. “Our situation is unprecedented beyond our worst nightmare,” shared Dr. Raji Sourani, the founder of the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, in August. “And while we work from a point of strategic optimism, we think the worst is yet to come for Gaza, which will be a permanent effort to push us south,” he warned, glancing out the window over the northern expanse of Gaza City.
