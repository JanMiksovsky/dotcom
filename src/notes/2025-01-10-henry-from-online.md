Henry recently shipped a big design update to his [website/digital garden](https://henry.codes/).

There are a lot of fun little details to dig into here, but most importantly, Henry is available to hire! He has some great [case studies](https://henry.codes/work/) written up here, and an [amazing resume](https://hireme.website/). I’m sure I’ll see this website linked to a lot for years to come.
