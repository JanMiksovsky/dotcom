Another day, another new social network. [Record Club](https://record.club/) wants to be the Goodreads or Letterboxd for recorded music. The platform is in invite-only non-public beta and its underlying data comes from [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/). You can follow artists and labels and other users, create lists, and review the albums you listen to. A lot of these features are things that Last.fm lacks, keeping that platform from feeling "social."

I am always looking for new and better ways to discover music, so I'm giving this one a shot. Looks like this site takes a cue from Bandcamp and is quite extensive with its [genre tags](https://record.club/genres). The UI and progressive web app (PWA) experience is quite good. I'm still kicking the tires on my new profile, but you can see what I'm up to at [https://record.club/nsmsn](https://record.club/nsmsn).
