_Bookmarked [Centering Accessibility in Data Visualization](https://www.urban.org/research/publication/do-no-harm-guide-centering-accessibility-data-visualization)._

> The authors explore why and how to create accessible data content, discussing issues such as how organizations can incorporate accessibility throughout their process, how to write effective alternative (alt) text, and how to implement accessible content onto the web.
