I would have loved to see a Mets victory over the Cardinals in Queens today, but was thrilled to watch [Pete Alonsoâ€™s 200th career home run](https://www.mlb.com/news/pete-alonso-hits-career-home-run-no-200).

Alonso is the fourth Met in franchise history to clear the 200 homer milestone, joining Darryl Strawberry (252), David Wright (242) and Mike Piazza (220). I'd love to see him stay with New York.
