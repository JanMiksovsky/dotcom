Whenever a song from [_Nashville Skyline_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville_Skyline) comes up on Apple Music, I always see a hidden "play" icon. It's a triangle formed in the negative space between the crook of Dylan's elbow, where his hand meets his hat, and neck meets his shoulder.

Maybe you can't un-see it now, like me.
