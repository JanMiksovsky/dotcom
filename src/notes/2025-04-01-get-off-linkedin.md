<p>Some great tips and takeaways here, but I especially love this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On Instagram, everyone is having a beautiful and wonderful life, except you. On LinkedIn, everyone is finding high-profile, well-paying jobs—except you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The best way to "keep your network warm"—("remind your friends that you exist")—is to catch up with these people when you don't want anything from them. That means that the best time to improve your ability to get a new job is when you don't need one.</p>
