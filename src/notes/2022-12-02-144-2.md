I read [Matthias Ott’s interesting conversation with ChatGPT](https://matthiasott.com/notes/a-conversation-with-chatgpt) last night.

AI chat bots always feel like a parlor trick, but one that keeps getting more and more sophisticated. I’m impressed/creeped out with ChatGPT’s cadence and the accuracy of the information relayed, at least **in this instance**.

Obviously, we will need good technical writers in the future. But it is _eerie_ to have your own job described to you by a bot.
