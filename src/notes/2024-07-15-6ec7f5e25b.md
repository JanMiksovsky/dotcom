![Email from Sticker Mule:
<div></div>
Hi Nick,
<div></div>
Donald Trump was shot.
<div></div>
I don’t care what your political views are but the hate for Trump and his supporters has gone too far.
<div></div>
People are terrified to admit they support Trump. I’ve been scared myself.
<div></div>
Americans shouldn’t live in fear.
<div></div>
I support Trump. Many at Sticker Mule do.
<div></div>
Many at Sticker Mule also support Biden.
<div></div>
The political hate needs to stop.
<div></div>
Hopefully this email helps.
<div></div>
Btw, this week, get 1 shirt for $4 (normally $19).
<div></div>
I suggest buying one that shows you support Trump.
<div></div>
The more people realize that millions of kind-hearted, compassionate people support Trump, the sooner the hate will end.
<div></div>
Awesome people, all over the world, love Trump. Don’t limit your friendships and diminish your happiness by indulging in political hate.
<div></div>
Vocalize your support. Stop the hate.
<div></div>

I signed up a long time ago for Sticker Mule promotions and have only ordered one item from them in the past. I unsubscribed and will be figuring out how to deactivate my account.

I don't support political violence. I also don't support businesses that try to tell me how I should vote. Going to try to find some worker-owned or unionized alternatives. Goodbye.
