_Bookmarked [Mozilla lays off 60 people, wants to build AI into Firefox](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/mozilla-lays-off-60-people-wants-to-build-ai-into-firefox/) by Ron Amadeo._

> Mozilla is a tiny company that competes with some of the biggest tech companies in the world—Apple, Google, and Microsoft. It's also very important to the web as a whole, as Firefox is the only browser that can't trace its lineage back to Apple and WebKit (Chrome's Blink engine is a WebKit fork. Microsoft Edge is a Chromium fork). So you would think focusing on Firefox would be a priority, but the company continually struggles with focus.

> The Mozilla Corporation gets about [80 percent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Corporation) of its revenue from Google—also its primary browser competitor—via a search deal, so Mozilla isn't exactly a healthy company. These non-browser projects could be seen as a search for a less vulnerable revenue stream, but none have put a huge dent in the bottom line.

I believe having a [diversity of browser engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_browser_engines) is the best path toward keeping the web healthy, open, and independent. I have a ton of browsers installed, but Firefox has been my default for a good 15+ years now. The overall user experience, privacy, speed, and developer tools in early 2024 Firefox suits me just fine. I even use the [containers](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/containers)! I want it to be maintained with new features coming to HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I want security patches and bug fixes. I want the browser experience to continue to be one I can customize to my needs. I want the core feature (browsing the web) to be the experience that is improved upon with each release. This is what I want and expect from a product I use every day of the week.

I'd love to see Mozilla become more independent from Google revenue-wise. But I don't need or want any of the other paid products in the Mozilla catalogue. I don't see the need for AI in my web browser. Spin off an up-to-date version of Firefox _without the AI stuff_, and I'd gladly pay to keep that going.
