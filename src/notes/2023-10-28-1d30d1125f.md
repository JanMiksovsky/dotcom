_Likes [SUCCESSFUL Adventures in setting up ActivityPub + Webfinger on a Flywheel-hosted WordPress site](https://piperhaywood.com/successful-adventures-in-setting-up-activitypub-webfinger-on-a-flywheel-hosted-wordpress-site/) by Piper Haywood._

It's not often I reference a personal blog post in a support ticket, but I'm so glad [Piper](https://piperhaywood.com/) and [Matthias](https://notiz.blog/) figured this one out! This is frankly a bit technically over my headâ€”one reason why my site's on [Flywheel](https://getflywheel.com/) in the first place.

WordPress.com owns the [ActivityPub plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/activitypub/) of course, and figured out how to [enable this for any of their users who want it](https://wordpress.com/blog/2023/10/11/activitypub/). Putting this post out there in the hopes more WP-dedicated hosting companies can support nerds like me that wanna put their websites out there on the "Fediverse".
