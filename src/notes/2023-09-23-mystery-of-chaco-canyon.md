Watched [The Mystery of Chaco Canyon (1999)](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0273858/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0_tt_3_nm_2_q_chaco%2520canyon), a documentary about the ancient site in the Southwestern US, about 100 miles from where I live now.

I havenâ€™t visited or read much about the site before, so I was fascinated by the archaeoastronomy: together the [structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaco_Culture_National_Historical_Park) form a gigantic solar and lunar calendar.
