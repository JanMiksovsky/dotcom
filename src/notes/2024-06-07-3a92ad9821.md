Binghamton Rumble Ponies. Richmond Flying Squirrels. Lehigh Valley Iron Pigs. Amarillo Sod Poodles. Rocket City Trash Pandas. Sugar Land Space Cowboys.

Every now and then I have to look at the [full list of minor league baseball teams](https://www.milb.com/about/teams) just to remind myself that these are real team names on uniforms, worn by real players, in real American cities, with mascots and official merch.

I would totally wear a [Rumble Ponies shirt](https://milbstore.com/products/brp-adult-gray-binghamton-rumble-ponies-t-shirt).
