_Bookmarked [Content Nation Backlash Highlights Mastodon’s Toxicity](https://wedistribute.org/2024/03/contentnation-mastodons-toxicity/) by Sean Tilley._

> Here’s the thing: if you were to take the [ActivityPub specification](https://w3c.github.io/activitypub/) from the W3C, and implement it as specified, you’d end up with something that wouldn’t correctly talk to any service in use today. Mastodon, and platforms designed to talk to it, have a dozen or so behaviors that are not actually in the spec at all: Webfinger, SharedInbox, Privacy Scopes, and Opt-Out for Search are just a few of them.
> 
> Many of these things are almost completely undocumented, and can only be developed by lengthy conversations with people who already built those things. [Even Mastodon’s own specs say very little](https://docs.joinmastodon.org). The majority of people dismissed Content Nation as simply being a malicious attempt to slurp up their public and private content for profit. Even when Sascha tried to defend himself, [he was ridiculed and mocked](https://cloudisland.nz/@sash@noc.social/112012866697731940).
