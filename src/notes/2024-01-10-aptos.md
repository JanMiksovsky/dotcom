The rollout of Microsoft's new font [Aptos](https://medium.com/microsoft-design/a-change-of-typeface-microsofts-new-default-font-has-arrived-f200eb16718d) is throwing me off. My emails in Outlook look weird. And why rename the typeface after a town in California? I thought that was Apple's thing, and I associate Microsoft with the state of Washington, anyway.
