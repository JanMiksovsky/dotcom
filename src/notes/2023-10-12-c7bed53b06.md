_Bookmarked [Classnames](https://classnames.paulrobertlloyd.com/)._

A great little resource for developers by [Paul Robert Lloyd](https://paulrobertlloyd.com/).

> This small website provides a list of words that you can refer to when naming something like an HTML class, custom CSS property or JavaScript function. Each word links to a page on [Wordnik](https://www.wordnik.com), an online dictionary that does the hard work of providing multiple definitions and listing related words.
