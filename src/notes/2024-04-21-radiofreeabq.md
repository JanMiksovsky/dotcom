Yesterday afternoon Eleanor and I had a family member babysit our kid and we headed to the patio at Canteen Brewhouse to catch [Radio Free ABQ](https://radiofreeabq.com/index.html). Their sound is “indie rock + Americana + desert noir” and here’s how they describe their influences:

> Calexico, Los Lobos, R.E.M., The Clash, Joe Strummer & The Mescaleros, The Police, Elvis Costello, David Bowie, Mark Guiliana, Paul Weller, Alejandro Escovedo, Morphine, Grant Lee Buffalo, The Iguanas, Bill Frisell, Medeski Martin & Wood, vintage tube amps, numbers stations, novels by Anthony Doerr and Paul Theroux, roasted green chiles.

I found this band while doing a web search for radio stations in Albuquerque last year. Glad I finally checked them out. We had a blast yesterday and I look forward to hearing more from these guys.
