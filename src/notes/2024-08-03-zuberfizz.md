I had a Durango Soda Co. ([Zuberfizz](https://zuberfizz.com/)) root beer with today's lunch, celebrating 14 years of marriage with [Eleanor](https://eleanoraldrich.com/) (our anniversary was earlier in the week). So tasty and refreshing, exactly what you'd want during the summer.

I linked to the [Zuberfizz website](https://zuberfizz.com/), but its a bit of a mess: cookie notices, popup chat windows, two different terms and conditions links in the footer... hire me to do your website, Zuberfizz! You deserve something as good as your soda.
