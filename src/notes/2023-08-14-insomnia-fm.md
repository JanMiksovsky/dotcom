Since moving to Albuquerque, I still can't find a favorite local radio station here. This morning I published an initial [list of unique stations](https://github.com/nsmsn/insomnia-fm) I can listen to via the web.

I welcome suggestions to add to this list, especially broadcasts outside the U.S. This list currently reflects a bias toward places I've lived or visited.
