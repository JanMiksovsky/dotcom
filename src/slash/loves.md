# Loves

This is an attempt to capture and highlight a few things that have meant a lot to me over the&nbsp;years.

&nbsp;

## Newspaper Comics

Comics were a huge part of developing visual literacy for me. My most beloved comic strips are:

- Calvin and Hobbes by Bill Watterson. Just a beautiful and imaginative artistic statement. I love the strips of Calvin careening through the woods in his red wagon with his imaginary friend.
- Krazy Kat by George Herriman. Discovered this incredible strip through a collection of old newspaper comics at the public library when I was in grade school. Later I ended up living in the real Coconino County after moving to Arizona.
- Peanuts by Charles Schulz. Peanuts was finishing its last decades in the newspaper when I was getting into the comics pages. Charlie Brown is one of the ultimate underdogs.
- Pogo by Walt Kelly. Great political satire and charming characters. I have a small vintage collection of Pogo books and memorabilia.

&nbsp;

## Sports

üèà Bills, üèÄ Knicks, ‚öæ Mets, üèí Sabres. These are the teams I picked as a kid. If anyone knows of a ‚öΩ team that can break my heart in equal measure, contact me.

I also follow the New York Liberty in WNBA, and Syracuse University for NCAA. My Nippon Professional Baseball team is Hiroshima Toyo Carp. And because I‚Äôm local and grew up on The Simpsons, I cheer on the Albuquerque Isotopes.

&nbsp;

## Music

While I still have my CD collection, these days I am acquiring new and old vinyl. And I use Apple Music and Bandcamp to stream stuff too.

Some of my favorite artists are:
ABBA, The Band, Big Star, Blackalicious, David Bowie, Calexico, Califone, Johnny Cash, John Coltrane, Sam Cooke, Miles Davis, DEVO, Bob Dylan, John Fahey, Flamin' Groovies, Funkadelic, Ghost, Guided By Voices, Woody Guthrie, John Hartford, The Kinks, Fela Kuti, Cate Le Bon, MF Doom, Minutemen, Thelonius Monk, Willie Nelson, New Order, Jim O'Rourke, Parliament, Pearls Before Swine, Wilson Pickett, Pixies, Prince, John Prine, R.E.M., Otis Redding, Run the Jewels, Patti Smith, Sly and the Family Stone, Smog, Sonic Youth, Mavis Staples, Talking Heads, Television, A Tribe Called Quest, Sharon Van Etten, Velvet Underground, XTC, Yo La Tengo, Neil&nbsp;Young.
Plus plenty of others I don‚Äôt have room to mention.

## Misc.

- If you‚Äôre looking for books, check out [my library](/library.html).
- I love Scrabble, and it is one of the only hashtags I follow on Mastodon. I also play Wordvoyance, an ad-free, screen reader accessible version on my phone.
- Cake vs. Pie: Cobbler.
- Hot sauce: Huy Fong Siriracha will always have a special place in my heart.
- New Mexican food: too many great things to list. This is a great place to live, visit, and eat.
