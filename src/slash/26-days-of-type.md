<p>In February 2024 I set out to publish a new long-form blog post every day. I had to double-up on one day, and successfully published 29 posts in 29 days. Really, I should have called this blogging series 26 Days of [Latin] Type, because I mostly focused on Latin alphabets and writing systems. <a href="/posts/a-font-is-a-personal-thing.html">There are limitations to personal projects</a>. This page captures all posts from this series in chronlogical order.</p>
