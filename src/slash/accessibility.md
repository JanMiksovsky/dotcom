# Accessibility Statement

The web is meant for everyone, and I am committed to designing useful, usable, and inclusive experiences.

I want as many people as possible to be able to use my website. For example, that means you should be able to:

- change colors, contrast levels and text sizes using your device settings.
- zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen.
- navigate most of the website using just a keyboard.
- listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver).

&nbsp;

## Standards and Testing

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) defines requirements for designers and developers to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities (and user friendly for everyone). My site is partially conformant with WCAG 2.2 level AA.

I use standards-compliant HTML, CSS, and JavaScript throughout this website. Anyone using a web browser that honors these standards should be capable of navigating this site.

In addition to being tested on the latest versions of Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari, this site has been manually checked for ease of use with a keyboard and the VoiceOver screen reader. I also periodically audit the site using WAVE, a browser-based testing service.
Features

Pages are structured with semantic elements like header, nav, main, and footer, which may help you move around more quickly. The main content area of each page is marked with a h1 (heading level 1), and each page’s structure should follow a logical heading order from there.

Each page on this website has a “skip to content” link at the top, and a “back to top” link at the very bottom.

Images are described with text alternatives, using the alt attribute. This website’s colors were chosen to ensure there is sufficient color contrast between elements on each page. My site has been coded to honor user device preferences whenever possible.

I strive to use plain language throughout this site and use a readability checker to test my content and improve my writing.

## Known Issues

Any known issues will be listed or described here, as they are reported or as I discover them.

I can’t guarantee that all content linked to or embedded on this site is fully accessible, though I will do my best to link to accessible and inclusive sites whenever possible.

## Share Feedback

I am personally committed to educating myself on digital accessibility, sharing what I learn, and putting it into practice. That said, if you encounter any difficulty using my site, please let me know! You may email me directly. I take these issues very seriously and welcome your feedback and suggestions.
