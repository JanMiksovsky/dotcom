🍂 I am currently:

- working as a UI designer with an awesome Digital Experience team.
- raising a preschooler with [Eleanor](https://eleanoraldrich.com).
- thinking about and planning the future of this website.
- ruminating on some other [ideas](/ideas.html).

## 📚 Reading

<div id="literal-widget" handle="nsmsn" status="IS_READING" layout="list"></div>
<script src="https://literal.club/js/widget.js"></script>

I use Literal to keep track of my reading.

## 🎧 Listening

<a href="https://www.last.fm/user/nsmsn"><img src="https://lastfm-recently-played.vercel.app/api?user=nsmsn&count=10&width=300" height="auto" width="300px" loading="lazy" alt="recently played songs from my Last dot FM profile"/></a>

[My last.fm account](https://www.last.fm/user/nsmsn) keeps track of music I listen to throughout the day. Stats are fun. I'm also scrobbling to [Libre.fm](https://libre.fm/user/nsmsn) now!
