🍂 I am currently:

- working as a UI designer with an awesome Digital Experience team.
- raising a preschooler with [Eleanor](https://eleanoraldrich.com).
- thinking about and planning the future of this website.
- ruminating on some other [ideas](/ideas.html).

## 📚 Reading

<div id="literal-widget" handle="nsmsn" status="IS_READING" layout="list"></div>
<script src="https://literal.club/js/widget.js"></script>

I use [Literal](https://literal.club/nsmsn/is-reading) to keep track of my reading.

## 🎧 Listening

[My last.fm account](https://www.last.fm/user/nsmsn) keeps track of music I listen to throughout the day. [Stats are fun](https://lastfmstats.com/user/nsmsn/dataset). I'm also scrobbling to [Libre.fm](https://libre.fm/user/nsmsn) as much as I can.
