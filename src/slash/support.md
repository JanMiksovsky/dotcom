# Support this site

This website is a hobby, and I’m not expecting to replace my day job or income by blogging. That said, it does cost a little money to run a website. My main expenses are web hosting each month and domain renewal costs each year.

If you like what I’m doing and want to support my blogging habit, there are a couple ways to support:

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://bookshop.org/shop/nsmsn">Buy a book from me</a>. I’m an affiliate of Bookshop.org and any purchases made using my links will earn me (and bookstores!) a small commission.</li>
    <li><a href="https://ko-fi.com/nsmsn">Buy me a coffee</a>. This website is powered by caffeine, and more coffee is always appreciated.</li>
</ul>
