Hey, you found my <code>/ideas</code> page. Here's a few things I’m currently ruminating about.

&nbsp;

1. **Democracy, etc**: Yes, immediately we must absolutely resist [the fascist threat](/notes/2024-03-17-fascist-threat.html) and protect voting rights and public goods. My longer term focus is on the worker's movement and rebuilding civil society.

2. **Arts and Crafts Movement for the 21st Century**: Thinking about reclaiming _craft_ in the digital age, when we designers have already industrialized our own profession and maybe paved the way for the current AI hype cycle, too.

3. **Who is picking up the mantle** after the [Web Standards Project declared victory in 2013](https://www.webstandards.org/2013/03/01/our-work-here-is-done/index.html)? Following writers like Alex Russell and Adrian Roselli, I am thinking about building with web standards as the right thing to do, yes, but also a mode of resistance to the larger tech industrial complex.

4. **Digital products should be built HTML-first**. CSS is the most powerful design tool for the web, and Firefox has the best dev tools of any browser. Sure there’s still room for visual tools like Figma and Penpot in the design process. I have found starting with HTML gets you closer to the structure and accessibility you will need in the final product.
