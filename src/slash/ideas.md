# Ideas

A collection of things I’m currently ruminating about 

&nbsp;

1. **Who is picking up the mantle** after the [Web Standards Project declared victory in 2013](https://www.webstandards.org/2013/03/01/our-work-here-is-done/index.html)? Following writers like Alex Russell and Adrian Roselli, I am thinking about building with web standards as the right thing to do, yes, but also a mode of resistance to the larger tech industrial complex.

2. **Digital products should be built HTML-first**. CSS is the most powerful design tool for the web, and Firefox has the best dev tools of any browser. There’s still room for visual tools like Figma and Penpot in the design process, but I have found starting with HTML gets you closer to the structure and accessibility you will need in the final product.

3. **more to be added** as I develop my other ideas a bit more.
