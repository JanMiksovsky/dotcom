# No, I do not accept guest posts.

Everything on this website is the work of **one person** (me!), and I plan on keeping it that&nbsp;way.

If you're genuinely interested in writing something and publishing on the web, you should totally create your own blog. Here's a great list of [blogging platforms](https://manuelmoreale.com/blog-platforms) to choose&nbsp;from.

If you've written something and would like me to read it, you can still <a href="mailto:nick@nicksimson.com">email me</a> a link to your post. I can't promise I will read it immediately. I can't promise I will link to it (share on my platform). But if there's something in it I like, I just might post a note or response on my own blog. That's how I think blogs should&nbsp;work.

If you email me about guest posts again after seeing this notice, I will block&nbsp;you.

I don't want SEO help, either.
