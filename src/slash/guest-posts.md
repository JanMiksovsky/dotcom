# No, I do not accept guest posts.

Everything on this website is the work of one person, and I plan on keeping it that&nbsp;way.

This is a **personal** website, so it doesn't make much sense for me to post things here authored by someone else. If you are interested in writing something and publishing on the internet, you should totally create your own blog. Here's a list of [blogging platforms](https://manuelmoreale.com/blog-platforms) to choose&nbsp;from.

If you've written something and would like me to read it, you can still <a href="mailto:nick@nicksimson.com">email me</a> a link to your post. I can't promise I will read it immediately. I can't promise I will link to it (share on my platform). But if there's something I like, I just might post a note or response on my own&nbsp;blog.

That's how I think blogs should work.
