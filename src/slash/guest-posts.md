# No, I do not accept guest posts.

Everything on this website is the work of one person, and I plan on keeping it that&nbsp;way.

This is a **personal** website, and it doesn't make much sense for me to post things here authored by someone else. If you are interested in writing something and publishing on the web, you should totally create your own blog. Here's a great list of [blogging platforms](https://manuelmoreale.com/blog-platforms) to choose&nbsp;from.

If you've written something and would like me to read it, you can still <a href="mailto:nick@nicksimson.com">email me</a> a link to your post. I can't promise I will read it immediately. I can't promise I will link to it (share on my platform). But if there's something I like, I just might post a note or response on my own blog. That's how I think blogs should&nbsp;work.

If you email me about guest posts again after seeing this notice, I will block&nbsp;you.

I don't want SEO help, either.
