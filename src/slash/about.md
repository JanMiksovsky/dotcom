# About

My name is Nick, short for *Nicholas* which means “[victory of the people](https://www.behindthename.com/name/nicholas).”

I’m a graphic and interaction designer, and my favorite medium to work with is the World Wide Web. I have been at this design thing professionally for more than 15 years, with most of that time spent working in-house with higher education institutions. Today I’m a user interface (UI) designer at a nonprofit member association in Washington, DC.

Through my design practice I’ve been lucky to work with some wonderful artists, musicians, scientists, and writers. I spent a long time as a generalist and thrive on learning new things.

See what I’m up to [now](/now.html).

I’m married to Eleanor, who makes paintings. We live in New Mexico with our preschooler and a small dog.

## This website

This is the sixth major version of nicksimson.com, a URL I registered in 2008. This is a static site, built with WebOrigami and hosted with Netlify.

The primary typeface is Hanken Grotesk, with <code>code samples</code> set in TK, and supporting text set in Server Mono.

Accessibility is very important to me, and I am working to make this site as performant and accessible as I know how.
