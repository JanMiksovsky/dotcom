A personal website. There are many out there, but this one is mine.

This project is built with [Web Origami](https://weborigami.org) using the [origami-starter](https://github.com/WebOrigami/origami-start) package.

License is MIT, but the text and images are copyright me. That means most of the `.md` (Markdown) files plus everything in the `/img/` directories. 

You're free to use this project to learn from, but **please don't steal my stuff**!
